# prompts.json Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated all modules, plugins, and external references into a single self-contained `prompts.json` file as requested in issue #138.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Completed Requirements

1. **Removed all @ref: references** - All 132+ external references have been inlined
2. **Consolidated all modules and plugins** - Content from 15+ JSON files merged into single file
3. **Added file_policy section** - Explicitly forbids unauthorized file creation
4. **Added core_restrictions section** - Immutable rules that cannot be overridden
5. **Single source of truth** - No external dependencies or module loading

### 📁 Files Consolidated

**Modules consolidated:**
- `modules/behavioral-rules.json` 
- `modules/universal-standards.json`
- `modules/workflow-engine.json` 
- `modules/quality-gates.json`

**Plugins consolidated:**
- `plugins/design-system.json`
- `plugins/web-development.json`
- `plugins/business-strategy.json`
- `plugins/ai-enhancement.json`

**Additional files consolidated:**
- `core.json`
- `formatting.json` 
- `validation.json`
- `usability.json`
- `webdev.json`
- `autonomous.json`

### 🔒 File Policy & Restrictions

**File Creation Policy:**
- Status: `FORBIDDEN`
- Rule: File creation explicitly prohibited without owner approval
- Enforcement: All agents must block unauthorized file creation
- No exceptions without explicit approval

**Core Restrictions:**
- Immutable rules that cannot be overridden
- Pre-action validation required
- Real-time monitoring for violations
- Automatic halt on restriction violation

### 📊 Validation Results

```
✅ JSON structure is valid
✅ No @ref: references found - all content is inlined  
✅ All required sections present
✅ File creation restrictions properly configured
✅ Core restrictions properly configured
✅ Core behavioral rules present
📊 File size: 89,461 bytes
📊 Line count: 1,763 lines
```

### 🎯 Key Sections Included

- **file_policy** - Explicit file creation restrictions
- **core_restrictions** - Immutable system rules
- **behavioral_rules** - Core operational constraints
- **universal_standards** - Centralized compliance requirements
- **design_system** - Complete design standards and patterns
- **web_development** - Ruby/Rails framework specifications
- **business_strategy** - Strategic planning tools and frameworks
- **autonomous_operation** - Self-improving capabilities
- **execution** - Workflow and phase management
- **design_intelligence** - UX psychology and design principles

### 🔄 Preserved Functionality

All original functionality has been preserved:
- Behavioral rules enforcement
- Universal standards compliance
- Design system patterns
- Web development frameworks
- Business strategy tools
- Autonomous operation capabilities
- Execution workflows
- Validation frameworks

## Verification

Run `python3 validate_consolidation.py` to verify:
- JSON structure validity
- No external references remain
- All required sections present
- File policies properly configured
- Core restrictions in place

## Result

✅ **Single self-contained prompts.json** - No external file dependencies
✅ **File creation forbidden** - Explicit policy prevents unauthorized changes  
✅ **All content preserved** - Zero functionality loss
✅ **No @ref: references** - All content directly inline
✅ **Comprehensive validation** - Automated verification of consolidation

The consolidated `prompts.json` now serves as the complete, self-contained framework with explicit file creation restrictions as required.
