# Master Framework v37.1.0 - Modular Structure

The Master Framework has been split into smaller, more manageable modules for better maintainability and organization.

## Module Structure

### Core Orchestrator
- **`core.json`** - Main framework orchestrator containing metadata, plugin orchestration, and scientific foundation

### Specialized Modules
- **`usability.json`** - Complete design intelligence including UX psychology, Nielsen heuristics, Swiss typography, parametric architecture, and cultural sensitivity
- **`formatting.json`** - Code formatting rules, error handling, and modular architecture patterns
- **`webdev.json`** - Technology-specific patterns for Ruby/Rails, OpenBSD security, Zsh scripting, and interface design
- **`autonomous.json`** - Self-improving capabilities, adaptive feedback loops, and conflict resolution hierarchy
- **`validation.json`** - Validation framework for design intelligence, technical excellence, and autonomous operations

## Size Comparison

- **Previous**: Single `master.json` file (32KB, 568 lines)
- **Current**: 6 modular files (30KB total, better organized)
  - `core.json`: 3KB
  - `usability.json`: 16KB (largest, contains comprehensive design intelligence)
  - `formatting.json`: 3KB
  - `webdev.json`: 3KB
  - `autonomous.json`: 3KB
  - `validation.json`: 1KB

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each file focuses on a specific domain
2. **Modularity**: Teams can work on different aspects independently
3. **Clarity**: Easier to locate and update specific functionality
4. **Reusability**: Individual modules can be used in different contexts
5. **Version Control**: Better tracking of changes to specific areas

## Integration

The `core.json` file serves as the main orchestrator and references all other modules through the `framework_modules` array in `plugin_orchestration.module_loader`.
