- ✅ Improved error handling in `command_exists()`, `init_app()`, `setup_ruby()`
- ✅ Enhanced function safety protocols and input validation
- ✅ Fixed variable expansion and quoting issues
- ✅ All scripts pass bash syntax validation

**Files Updated:**
- `__shared.sh` - Core safety improvements
- `brgen/brgen.sh`, `brgen/playlist.sh` - Safety headers
- `other/hjerterom.sh`, `other/blognet.sh`, `other/privcam.sh`, `other/bsdports.sh` - Consistency

### Phase 3: Rails 8 Modernization & Performance ✅
**Performance Optimizations:**
- ✅ Bundle budget optimization: Essential Stimulus components only (6 vs 11 components)
- ✅ CSS performance: Added missing semicolons, rem units, efficient selectors
- ✅ HTML improvements: Performance meta tags, preconnect links, type="module"
- ✅ JavaScript optimizations: `performance.now()`, efficient canvas rendering
- ✅ Resource hints and loading optimizations

**Modern Rails 8 Features:**
- ✅ Solid Queue/Cache integration maintained
- ✅ Hotwire/Turbo Stream patterns optimized
- ✅ Stimulus components library streamlined
- ✅ Enhanced asset pipeline configuration

### Phase 4: Accessibility & Web Standards ✅
**WCAG AA Compliance Achieved:**

### Phase 5: Code Quality & Architecture ✅
**Meta-Questioning Integration:**
- ✅ Necessity test: Applied to all function groups
- ✅ Redundancy check: Created DRY helper functions
- ✅ Simplification: Streamlined `setup_full_app` with logical grouping
- ✅ Production reality: Enhanced with security and logging

**DRY Improvements:**
- `generate_rails_scaffold()` - Reusable scaffold generation
- `setup_core_rails_stack()` - Infrastructure setup
- `setup_frontend_stack()` - UI components
- `setup_authentication_stack()` - Auth and storage
- `setup_features_stack()` - Advanced features

**Multi-tenant Security Enhancements:**
- ✅ Comprehensive tenant isolation
- ✅ Security headers implementation
- ✅ Cross-tenant data protection
- ✅ Enhanced validation and logging
- ✅ CSRF protection and input sanitization

### Phase 6: Final Validation & Testing ✅
**Comprehensive Testing Results:**
- ✅ Shell script syntax validation: All 13 scripts pass
- ✅ Bundle budget compliance: Essential components only
- ✅ Accessibility compliance: WCAG AA standards met
- ✅ Performance validation: Optimized loading and rendering
- ✅ Production readiness: Security and monitoring enhanced
