# PR Consolidation Tools

This directory contains tools for identifying and closing redundant pull requests to reduce maintenance overhead and focus on the most comprehensive implementations.

## Quick Start

### Run Analysis
```bash
ruby close_redundant_prs.rb
```

### Use GitHub Actions
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **"Close Redundant PRs"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. First run with `dry_run=true` to preview changes
5. Then run with `dry_run=false` and `confirm_closure="CONFIRM"` to execute

## Files Overview

### Analysis Tools
- **`close_redundant_prs.rb`** - Main analysis script
- **`redundant_pr_report.json`** - Generated JSON report (machine-readable)

### Automation
- **`.github/workflows/close_redundant_prs.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated closure

### Documentation
- **`PR_CONSOLIDATION.md`** - Comprehensive documentation of consolidation process
- **`README_PR_CONSOLIDATION.md`** - This file

## Current Analysis Results

### PRs to Close (4 total)

#### Master.json Framework (3 PRs superseded by PR #38)
- **PR #16**: Enhanced master.json Configuration with Workflow Intelligence
- **PR #27**: Master.json v12.9.0 Framework with Extreme Scrutiny and Circuit Breakers
- **PR #34**: Complete Master.json v12.9.0 Framework Implementation with Circuit Breakers

#### Visualizer (1 PR superseded by PR #39)
- **PR #22**: Multi-mode sacred geometry visualizer

### Superior Implementations to Keep
- **PR #38**: Most comprehensive master.json v12.9.0 implementation
- **PR #39**: Enhanced sacred geometry visualizer with J Dilla integration

## Safety Features

### Dry Run Mode
- Default mode for GitHub Actions workflow
- Analyzes PRs without making changes
- Provides preview of actions that would be taken

### Confirmation Required
- Manual confirmation required for actual PR closures
- Must type "CONFIRM" to proceed with closures
- Prevents accidental execution

### Respectful Closure
- Adds explanatory comments to each PR before closing
- Thanks contributors for their work
- Explains how functionality was incorporated into superior PRs

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Analysis
```bash
# Run full analysis
ruby close_redundant_prs.rb

# View JSON report
cat redundant_pr_report.json | jq '.'
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# Preview mode (safe)
dry_run: true
confirm_closure: ""

# Execution mode (requires confirmation)
dry_run: false
confirm_closure: "CONFIRM"
```

### Manual Closure Process
```bash
# 1. Review analysis
ruby close_redundant_prs.rb

# 2. For each PR to close:
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "$(cat closure_comment.txt)"
gh pr close <PR_NUMBER>

# 3. Verify closure
gh pr list --state closed
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer PRs to review and maintain
2. **Clearer Development**: Focus on best implementations
3. **Better Code Quality**: Consolidated efforts in superior PRs
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Team focus on key PRs
5. **Enhanced Documentation**: Single source of truth per feature

## Verification Steps

After running the consolidation:

1. **Check PR Status**: Verify redundant PRs are closed
2. **Review Comments**: Ensure closure comments are appropriate
3. **Validate Superseding PRs**: Confirm PR #38 and #39 contain all functionality
4. **Update References**: Fix any documentation links to closed PRs
5. **Team Communication**: Notify contributors of consolidation

## Error Handling

The tools include several safety mechanisms:

- **Validation**: Confirms all required inputs before execution
- **Logging**: Detailed output for each action taken
- **Rollback**: Manual process to reopen PRs if needed
- **Dry Run**: Preview mode to validate actions before execution

## Contributing

To modify the analysis or add new redundant PRs:

1. Edit `close_redundant_prs.rb`
2. Update the `@redundant_prs` array with new entries
3. Add corresponding entries to `@superseding_prs` if needed
4. Test with `ruby close_redundant_prs.rb`
5. Update GitHub Actions workflow if needed

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the generated analysis report
2. Review `PR_CONSOLIDATION.md` for detailed explanations
3. Examine the GitHub Actions workflow logs
4. Verify PR status manually with `gh pr list`

## Security

- Workflow requires explicit confirmation for closures
- No automatic execution without manual approval
- All actions logged and traceable
- Can be reversed if needed
