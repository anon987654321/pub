# Prompts.json Refactoring - Complete Overhaul

## Summary
Successfully refactored prompts.json from 3,212 lines to 209 lines (93% reduction) while meeting all requirements for clarity, DRY principles, and user-friendliness.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Meta Section
- **Before**: Extensive procedural metadata (145 lines of meta configuration)
- **After**: Minimal metadata with only version and description (4 lines)
- **Removed**: llm_processing_guidelines, content_preservation_policy, project_overrides, weekly_automated_analysis, restoration_summary

### 2. Renamed and Consolidated Core Sections
- `universal_standards` → `standards` (clearer, more direct)
- `behavioral_rules` → `rules` (simplified structure) 
- **Created** `completion_criteria` (consolidated from scattered project completion logic)
- **Kept**: `design_system`, `business_strategy`, `communication`

### 3. Removed Deeply Technical Sections
- `ai_enhancement` (1,886+ lines)
- `specialized_capabilities` (442+ lines) 
- `infrastructure_preservation`
- `validation_enhancement`
- `self_optimization`
- `autonomous_completion` (moved essential parts to completion_criteria)
- Complex workflow, monitoring, and circuit breaker systems

### 4. Applied DRY and Clarity Principles
- **Eliminated**: All @ref: cross-references and duplicate content
- **Simplified**: Technical language to plain English
- **Consolidated**: Overlapping completion criteria into single section
- **Clarified**: All descriptions for both technical and non-technical users

### 5. Added Required Rule
- **New rule**: "no_decorative_comments" - Comments in code/config must never contain decorative ASCII art, only helpful explanations

## Structure Comparison

```
meta (145 lines of complex metadata)
universal_standards
behavioral_rules  
principles
web_development

completion_criteria (what "done" means for different project types)
