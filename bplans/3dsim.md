## Most Detailed Human Simulation: Leveraging hAPI's Public Healthcare Unified Integration (PHUI)

### Vision:

The goal is to create a detailed 3D human model simulation in a virtual environment, capturing intricacies down to the molecular and possibly atomic level.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (44 words > 15) --> This project aims to create a space that replicates known physical laws for rigorous scientific experimentation and discovery.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (18 words > 15) --> The project uses Ruby and Mittsu, providing a unique approach compared to existing specialized molecular biology software.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (17 words > 15) --> ### Unique Approach:

This project uses Ruby methods as modular building blocks for constructing and simulating molecular models.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (18 words > 15) --> This modular approach allows for a clean, organized codebase that can be easily extended and integrated.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (16 words > 15) --> ### Why Ruby and Mittsu? Standard 3D engines like Blender are not designed to handle the extreme scales involved in molecular or atomic models.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (19 words > 15) --> Ruby and Mittsu offer the flexibility for custom scaling and rendering solutions, allowing the project to address challenges that are difficult to solve using traditional 3D engines.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (27 words > 15) --> ### Objective:

The aim is to use Artificial Intelligence to perform extensive, multifaceted tests on this human model.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (18 words > 15) --> By using Ruby methods as building blocks, the project aims to push scientific boundaries, providing a new platform for research and discoveries.
