## Technical Documentation (Archived)

**Note: The following technical content is preserved for historical and educational documentation only.**

### Original File Purpose
The original `druglab.rb` file was a Ruby script that simulated interaction with laboratory equipment through a hypothetical API.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (158 words > 15) --> It demonstrated software design patterns commonly used in industrial automation and scientific computing. ### Programming Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Class-based Design**: Object-oriented approach to system control
2. **API Communication**: HTTP requests and JSON data handling
3. **Error Handling**: Robust exception management
4. **Method Organization**: Logical separation of concerns
5. **Parameter Validation**: Input sanitization and verification

### Educational Value
From a pure software development perspective, the file demonstrated:
- Clean Ruby code structure and conventions
- RESTful API client implementation
- Industrial control system simulation
- JSON serialization and HTTP communication
- Object-oriented design principles

### Security Considerations in Original Code
The original implementation included several security considerations:
- Input validation for API parameters
- Error handling for network failures
- Logging mechanisms for audit trails
- Structured exception handling

### Why This Content Required Archiving
1.
<!-- TODO: Break into shorter sentences (87 words > 15) --> **Content Sensitivity**: References to controlled substances
2. **Potential Misinterpretation**: Could be misunderstood as instructional
3. **Legal Caution**: Better to archive with disclaimers than risk issues
4. **Professional Standards**: Maintaining responsible code repository practices

### Alternative Educational Resources
For learning the same programming concepts demonstrated in the original file, consider:
- Ruby API client tutorials using public APIs
- Industrial automation simulation with safe examples
- Laboratory information management system (LIMS) development
- Scientific computing applications in Ruby
