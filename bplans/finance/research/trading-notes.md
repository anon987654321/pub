##economics: Is it better trading BTC on exchanges with larger transaction volume or does that not matter?

<uiop> you'd need to define your metric to know what "better" means... but one metric for goodness that makes sense is the triple of {bid-ask-spread size, exchange transaction costs, order book depth}
<uiop> depending on the size you're trading, the frequency you're trading it, and how rapidly you need to be able to get in and out with minimal slippage.... some subset of those 3 may be more or less important to you
<uiop> also, which exchange to use for btc depends also on whether you just want to go long-only spot with no leverage (iow you want to just own btc), or you want long-short spot with leverage, or you want to trade futures (which make even more leverage available than spot margin trading leverage)
<uiop> so in summary, 1) answer the previous ^ question.. this will narrow exchange choice down...... then 2) if there are >1 exchange possibilities remaining, then decide among them based on my first criteria given your trading characteristics

I have been quietly learning and researching crypto since November 2017, so I am absolutely new to this. I got in after hearing from friends about XRP is going to "blow up" and I need to get in now or I'm going to miss the bus. Naturally, I gave in and put 1000$ on something that I knew nothing about. Since then, I have learned some valuable information and had some good learning experiences that I want to share.

    Do not put money into crypto that you cannot afford to lose. This is gambling, no other way about it. Most of these projects will fail, and if you put all your investment into a single project, you will lose that money.

    Do not day trade. Trying to catch waves daily may work in the short term, but will not give you long term gains. Research the companies and platforms, choose carefully where you want to invest, buy your coins, store them somewhere safe, and leave them alone. Even if the market tanks, like what happened the other day with South Korea, just leave it alone because this is just money that you can easily afford to lose.

    Do not listen to the shills on the internet. Don't listen to CNBC, "experts" on Youtube, reddit posts claiming to have the new moon coin, or anything else. As previously stated, do your research, find companies with actual promising partnerships and a real product that solves a real problem, and invest with them.

    Cash out your principal after you've made some modest gains. Playing with house money is the best way to play. Also, you may want to set up "mile markers". For example, if my portfolio gets to X amount, I will cash out Y amount and pay off a credit card. If it then gets to Z amount, I'll cash out another Y, and so on.

    Simply have faith in yourself that you've made sound decisions and those decisions will pay off in the long run. No one knows where this will go, but I think it's going to be much larger than anything we can imagine.

With all that said, this is my portfolio based on everything that I've learned over the past 90 or so days:

    40% Ethereum

    30% VEN

    10% XRB

    10% ICON

    10% NEO

Of course there could be coins that I'm missing out on, like WTC, and that will always be the case, But, to me, these are sound choices, and I'm very content to sit back and watch what happens. If anyone feels like I'm incorrect or haven't included an important piece of information, please correct me. Like I said, I'm still brand new, but I feel like reading something simple like this would've helped me a lot on day 1. Good luck to everyone, I think this year is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.

Just watched a whale crush it on GDAX. So jelly. (self.BitcoinMarkets)

Around 12:30pm (EST) I watched someone with a lot of money repeatedly pull off a classic lure. Posts a sell wall, waits a bit, then leaves it posted while buying up all of the buys that have settled in. Pulls sell wall. Price drops considerably, then trader buys up everything until price rises again. Sets up sell wall again. Rinse and repeat.

I've watched her snap up everything in the 14250 - 14300 range over and over. This person/organization has some serious money to spend. Also a pretty clear signal that they think that's a good price to go long from. I've entered long, accordingly. YMMV.

Wish I had a few million and a solid algo!

You're totally ok, mate! No need to fret. Everyone is new at some point, and we're all better for being open to learning no matter what our history.

A wall is when a lot of orders stack up at a certain price. So if you see that orders are pretty spread thin, but then there's a bunch of them stacked up at one price, you've spotted a wall. It doesn't mean anything inherently, but it can be a signal that certain trading behavior is occurring.

You can pull a wall (if you are the one who listed all the orders) by cancelling your orders, or by filling them from a different account. Pulling it basically just means all of the sudden there is no more wall at that price point.

I spotted the whale by watching the order book and the trade history. These tools are available on GDAX, where I trade BTC. Although GDAX doesn't have completely appropriate tools for my style of trading, they're better than the competition I've seen. I use a style of trading called order flow analysis. I think it's lightyears better than technical analysis, which is just trying to read patterns out of the charts. Charts tell you what happened in the past, but not why. Depth of market tools show you the active trading volume moment-to-moment. I prefer going off of that information. Googling it should give you some good resources. It applies to all types of trading.

I spotted the whale making a move by watching the order book. A large sell wall would go up. It would get picked at but not bought out (meaning there remained a large number of orders). As orders were filled from it (meaning people bought BTC at that price point), it was actively being refilled, which means it's called an iceberg. All that means is that there are more orders at that price point than are listed. The whale has them queued up to fire off only when orders are filled from the current wall.

Then I would notice the price of the market adjust to the wall and people would start piling up behind it (meaning they moved their target buy price to be just under the wall).

Then all of those orders would get bought up all at once. Literally 50 or more orders executed in 1 second. That's a good sign that a single entity is controlling the floor.

Once the orders were bought up, the wall fell and prices fall pretty dramatically, because all of the buying limit orders have been gobbled up. As the liquidity falls, the market chases it down (meaning there are no more contracts at one price, so the market moves down to the next).

Once the market bottomed out (largely because the whale stopped buying), the whale would allow it to go back up, in part by re-implementing a buying wall.

And so it's a cycle of controlling the market going up and down. The trader is either walking away with a lot of BTC in pocket within the 14,250 range, or they're simply scalping the market, making money each time the market swings one way or another. They'll often fade against the market (trade against, as in if it's going down, they buy up) when they have such good control of it.

Could I have taken advantage of the whale's movements? Hell yeah. That's really the only way to play. I'm a small player. I don't have much capital floating around in the BTC markets. I can't control them or influence them at all. So it behooves me to watch what the big guys are doing, and then follow suit. I prefer to scalp (meaning take really short, sometimes low value trades), but I don't have the money for that in this market, especially since GDAX doesn't offer leverage (i.e. $100 of your buckets is worth $1000 for trading b/c GDAX spots you the money). If I had millions like this whale, I would scalp the shit out of the market.

As it stands, I try to identify when a strategy like this is playing out, and I try to enter the right side of it. I could go with the whale, buying at 250 and selling at 350, or I could just wait for 250 and then buy it there, hoping to go long on it. Best bet is to ride it up and down, but again, that takes money. Ultimately, I just opted to go long, as the market looks to be ready for a rally to me.

Please feel free to ask more questions if you have them.

I think futures are good, it will bring institutional money which has been in the pipeline since last year.

Personally i stay away from futures because the cryptocurrency market is so volatile that I don't want to risk too much. I also haven't done enough research to know which sites to trust either. (Although Gemini seems decent with a quick look into it.)

The whole CME thing will hopefully be a part in making cryptocurrencies more mainstream. It will also bring more credibility into it for those who don't want another MT. Gox scandal. Either way I think it would be wise to be cautious of futures in general.

'Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price'.

    Does that sound like a good idea in this volatile market? No, no it doesn't. People have bought futures in something that isn't even happening anymore. Essentially spending money on something that doesn't exist. That's a problem.

Limiting futures so that trading halts happen during extreme price fluctuations is a step in the right direction.. But i still think it's way way too early to be messing around with futures in this market.

When it's regulated on a global scale like the stock market, sure, lets do that.. But now? When someone can just pull the plug on something like Segwit2x , and others can manipulate the prices of whichever currencies they want and make off like bandits with millions of dollars? Stay away from futures. This isn't the stock market, it's the wild west right now.

I don't trade futures, just options. I like Deribit as has a clean interface a good liquidity. BitMEX has much more liquidity though. As for the CME, it's a step in the right direction. Institutional money needs regulated derivatives to invest in cryptocurrency. Once that's in place money will pour in like never before.

Daniel Sesay, Trader
Answered Oct 25, 2016

I have answered this question in various formats so I will take another stab. It always amazes me that people have titles such as Trader, Quant, etc and still say stuff like “trading isn't profitable” yet they are traders or they say retail traders lose money but they are retail traders themselves. So why are they wasting their time? Should they not quit? I hate negativity especially when it is cynicism rather than truth. I never engage in anything unprofitable. Life is too short.

To answer the question… If you were trading an average of 100,000 base currency per day and you have what it takes (I.e. you are not a Bob Geldof fancy trading kind of guy) then you should make at least $300 a day net of cost, after all the cost trading is high so that would be in reality $400 without broker cost (the necessary evil). The issue is most people wouldn't dare trade this volume for a number of personal reasons, fear, insufficient knowledge and lack of self belief. So in the long run the 10000 base trades get boring as 10 years later you have barely made any head way. As a day trader you must thrive on being at the edge of a knife, the best traders don't have the same regard for capital as the everyday man. If you are afraid of risk, don't like losing money, etc. Then don't trade at all, day trade or year trade. If you trade 1,000,000 base then you are going to be looking at $3000 a day at least but to even buy the position you need $5000 in margin alone and another $5000 of exposure. I would assume at this level you are so invested in trading to even think negatively about it, you could only harm yourself. The only reason to trade is make money, no point if you are earning $30 a day. The irony is the individuals outside of the professional space that can afford to muster even 10000 and risk it tend to already have day jobs that they will never leave that means most people are in the smaller capital bracket and 100% quit in 5 years and generally active for 1 year, that's 100% failure rate of small accounts.

This is the reason why 10% are serious traders and 90% are not. These 90% have trading accounts but are not real traders, having a scalpel doesn't make you a surgeon. So if you want to be in the 10% become a real trader. Otherwise keep your day job, you will never be committed enough to make money that will take you above the rest.

For example, you would need to ask yourself if you think more people are going to adopt bitcoin as a legitimate currency, and if so, why? What advantages/disadvantages does it have over traditional currencies? And on top of that, you would have to consider if it's current valuation is justified. These are hard questions for sure - if they were easy, everyone would be rich!

<!--Dette slo meg som et beundringsverdig mål: Søk 1-2 prosent volatilitet per dag, sikte på å handle klokt for det deltaet, gjøre handelen og gjøres. Faktisk, min venn Dan pleide å gjøre noe veldig slikt ved å handle Transmeta-aksjen på et regime med "kjøp på $ 2, selg på $ 4". Fordi aksjen var ganske volatil, fant han at han doblet pengene sine et par ganger i året, og han holdt ikke så mye penger på aksjen at han ville bli ødelagt hvis den skulle forsvinne helt. Forskjellen er at Bitcoin er langt mer flyktig enn til og med Transmeta-aksjen var.

Vel, i praksis virker det egentlig ikke for mine formål. Problemet med å bruke EMA for å avgjøre om å handle eller ikke, er at det egentlig er mer egnet til en langsiktig strategi. I mitt eget tilfelle er jeg fornøyd med en eller to prosent gevinst, og ønsker å ha så lite eksponering som mulig for volatiliteten til Bitcoin annet enn det (dette er å si at i løpet av 2013 har vi kanskje sett en femti ganger økning i verdien av valutaen, er jeg skeptisk til en gjentagelse for 2014, og foretrekker å ha en daglig inntekt i stedet for å "satse på gården" på det samme som skjer igjen, min følelse på dette kan endres).

  Is it logical that the more platforms I trade on the more money I'll make? Or is this a huge misconception?

Well, it's a catchy headline that CNBC article, they love writing stuff
like that, but you realize of course that it's just one man's opinion.

I think the most challenging thing, as far as running bitcoin based fund
is to be able to find liquid enough underlyings you can trade against your
positions.  Especially important once you have larger amounts under
management.  None of the regulated market places offer yet anything
liquid.  Even the bitcoin ETFs (Like GBTC) that exist hardly trade at all.
Hopefully that changes soon and people will be able to trade and hedge
their positions with good products.

Trading bitcoin outright, on the other hand, has the counter party risk as
none of the "exchanges" are regulated in any way, and most run (or used to
run) in China.  So none of them are insured and who knows how much capital
they actually have, so keeping large positions in their trading accounts
can be risky.

CME Group in Chicago is planning to introduce bitcoin futures listed on
regulated futures exchange (CBOE), and I hope that happens soon.
http://www.cboe.com/blogs/options-hub/2017/08/06/the-weekly-options-news-roundup-8-6-2017

If that happens it should make running even a larger bitcoin fund a lot
easier.  It depends on though whether they introduce also options on
futures and whether market makers will make good markets.  Having liquid
options on bitcoin would make it very appealing as it brings the
possibility to trade it with probabilities and sell premium against your
long (or short) bitcoin positions.

Of course you can run a simple long "buy and hold" bitcoin fund and hope
for the best, but I think it will be a bumpy ride, as bitcoin is very
volatile.  Personally I'd look to somehow hedge the positions but at the
moment that's not so easy.

Just my 2cents.

The papers you got from Genesis were pretty ok. The first one about
diversification is good and to the point, as long as you can find a liquid
product you can trade easily so that it's easy to incorporate them to your
overall portfolio.

--

The fact that you have to actually buy real bitcoins
now is not very good situation. We need to be able to trade bitcoin
without needing to actually buy real bitcoins (just like we trade gold
without buying physical gold). This should be possible next year,
hopefully.

The other paper was a bit of a reach I think. Their argument that bitcoin
could be hedge for global liquidty problems is not reality now. It (or
other cryptocurrencies) may become that in the future, but the market is
just way too small for that right now. There's still no serious money
going into bitcoin, and won't be without it getting regulatory approval.
But if it gets it, it could become interesting. Currently the typical
"safe haven" assets are Gold, Bonds and Yen.

I'm just planning to invest in stocks market but this is what I observed base on my studying before entering it.

1. In stocks, the profit is very slow. It will take years to see your profit.

2. In bitcoin,it will only take a couple of days or months and you can get an instant profit.

Stock is safe because it is backed up by the government, bitcoin is decentralized but we do trust it.

Both of them are risky but bitcoin is better and profitable.

Profit estimation for Bittrex?

Hi,

My name is George, I'm 22 and I found you via GitHub.

I was wondering, is there a way to do a simple profit prediction for Bittrex? Which factors would one have to know beforehand? Doesn't have to be accurate at all.

For instance, I have a formula, if you can call it that, for the P2P trading platform LocalBitcoins. It's basically the weekly trade volume in my country, divided by the amount of traders in my country, and then multiplied by a 5% commission for each trade. This ends up showing how much one can potentially make assuming all traders get an equal amount of trades (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1EkbqHyCJoiMHVWbTRrSnJiaTA/view?usp=sharing). Not very realistic, but it's something.

I reckon predicting profits on Bittrex would be different, as there people trade more based on volatility and price, often using bots with fancy trade indicators, whereas on LocalBitcoins they trade more on a whim.

Thanks!

All the best,
George

Hi!

> It sounds like your idea is to trade based on the volatility, buying low and selling high in equal volumes?

Pretty much, yeah.

> You could do a rough calculation with daily trading volume and average bid-ask spread, which you could pull from the historical data using GDAX API. As you see when you look at the live exchange, there's a lot of trading going on, and much of it is probably driven by bots. You could do something like find the high and low daily price and imagine you could trade at those prices and see how you would do. Of course, in reality it's much harder and you'll find any actual profit might be very small (or even negative :)).

Oh man - this is exactly what I needed to know. Thank you so much!

> To get a more accurate estimate, you might have to pull the historical prices and run your own algorithm against the data to see how it does. Some keywords that might help you if you're curious for more info: backtesting, paper trading.

This is really cool as well but for now I should be fine with your first suggestion. I'll try and mess around and let you know how it goes.

Thanks again,
George

Hi!

Here's what I have so far:

- Daily trade volume; from Trade History at https://bitcoincharts.com/markets/coinbaseUSD_trades.html I see $223,894,387.36 (1d)
- Average bid-ask spread; from Summary at https://bitcoincharts.com/markets/coinbaseUSD_trades.html I take "Best Ask: 6600.48" minus "Best Bid: 6600.26" = 0.21999999999
- High and low daily price; from "11/10 1:00 AM - 11/11 1:00 AM → O: 7,156.00 H: 7,350.00 L: 6,614.89 C: 6,718.98 V: 19,518" at https://gdax.com/trade get the value of "H" and "L"

I tried looking at the GDAX API, ie. https://api.gdax.com/products/BTC-USD/ticker and https://api.gdax.com/products/BTC-USD/book but couln't seem to find any of the above. But if it's correct, how would an estimation look like mathematically?

> To get a more accurate estimate, you might have to pull the historical prices and run your own algorithm against the data to see how it does.

Currently also dabbling with prediction models for the whole CME/Winklevoss twins' thing with bitcoin futures/options on Gemini/Deribit. I can show you what I end up with.

All the best,

I can’t say that I’ve ever come up with a profit prediction formula. Most of my work has revolved around using the so-called ‘fancy trade indicators’, but I’ve not had much success. I think using a combination of a volume indicator and price movement, on multiple candlestick time periods, may be the key.

I’d say most of my problems have been entering and exiting the market. I have scripts to buy/sell BTC via market-making limit orders on GDAX, which are free, but in times of high volatility, the market can move more than the fee I would have paid. But if I am too quick to switch to market orders, I can end up losing 0.5% on top of whatever sudden turn the market has made.

So it seems the trick seems to be balancing between when to use free limit orders and when it’s better to just get in the market, but I still haven’t figured this out!

Have you had much success with your formula for LocalBitcoins?

22:08 <braverock_wk> the most likely amount to be made by a naive model is negative
22:08 <braverock_wk> the most optimistic amount to be made by a naive model is the trend line
22:08 <braverock_wk> a random strategy should have a mean around zero in most cases

Things like interest rates, crude oil, and I guess gold too, are ones
that have some predictability so they make markets anywhere from
5-10 years into the future. For stocks and currencies, usually 1-2
years is max. But, they're not accurate in any way...

Riksmynt needs 800 000kr, 400 000kr of which will be spent holding/trading Bitcoin and Lisk. The other 400 000kr will be spent building a Nordic bitcoin exchange[1].

Surplus will go partly to repaying investors, and partly to paying share holders.

How are crypto prices connected to stock market prices?

19:26 < budfox> Also, making money regardless whether price goes up or down, that's not what they call scalping right?
19:27 < solidfox> budfox, yes
19:27 < moriarty> budfox, you got to know at least a bit about what you want to hire for otherwise how are you going to manage your workforce?
19:27 < moriarty> what's the measure of good if you dont know what good is :)
19:27 < solidfox> scalping is like, we're not gonna buy and hold, but just keep trying to make bets and sell them for tiny profits
19:28 < plaerzen> budfox: I know some very, very smart people (and some dumb ones) who've tried algo-trading and all have failed.
19:28 < solidfox> i tried it and failed!
19:28 < moriarty> budfox, lol it's not about trust or lack thereof, but it's more about how you're going to choose among all the traders
19:28 < solidfox> its because some hacker steals your algorithm and trains their algorithm against yours!
19:29 < moriarty> or what the specifications of your system is :)
19:29 < dumnut> hi budfox
19:29 < solidfox> constant training against the real market as well
19:29 < plaerzen> solium capital, they do big business, I know the guys who started that company and they are some smart dudes in both math, finance and computer science
19:29 < budfox> solidfox: ah ok, that makes sense. i seem to recall y'all talking about trading in very small amounts
19:29 < moriarty> e.g. a person who knows next to nothing about housing, would just tell a builder, make me a house :) and then get disappointed when he finds that the walls are not coated with weather proofing, or that the tiles are cheap unglazed ones, etc
19:29 < plaerzen> they couldn't make a profitable trading bot
19:29 < solidfox> budfox, I don't like it. someone else was doing that. python314 or something
19:29 < moriarty> so knowledge of specifications helps you pin things down for a budget you can afford
19:31 < plaerzen> budfox: get good at regular trading
19:31 < moriarty> budfox, maybe paper trade a bit, ask questions if you have any about trading, and then get a sense of what's possible, and what kind of risk you want to take on for your trading bots and consequently the people you want to hire to help build these
19:57 < Henry151> if you look at the history there on that chart, you can see where it bought and sold by where the rsi signal line turns green (buys when it turns from red to green, sells when it turns from green to red).... it hasn't made any profits, but the losses haven't been very bad

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/zwv7sZG3/

19:58 < Henry151> budfox: https://d.tube/#!/v/crypto49er/t0olnilf crypto49er explains it better than I can
19:59 < Henry151> I think the strat will allow me to make huge profits during a bull trend, while minimizing losses during a bear trend... the hard part is when it keeps switching from bear to bull and back again, that's where it loses
19:59 < Henry151> so the choice of which two moving averages to look at to determine whether we're in a bear or a bull trend is pretty important
19:59 < budfox> Henry151: I'm just running the stable version
20:00 < Henry151> budfox: if you installed and set up recently, stable is v6.xx
20:00 < Henry151> I actually am using a much older version for my live bots, because I don't want to
                  break them trying to upgrade
20:01 < budfox> Henry151: well its running as root which im not too content about :D but its just a test. isn't it lacking in support for exchanges?
20:01 < Henry151> but I have a bleeding-edge version set up that I use for my backtesting and I use gekkoGA to find best parameters
20:01 < Henry151> I use it with binance and poloniex primarily
20:01 < budfox> Henry151: i also want to redo its layout using http://framework7.io/ lol
20:01 < Henry151> but I had it running with Gemini at one point
20:12 < Henry151> you know what i think is the most exciting new technology since bitcoin?
