23:02 <jmalicki> does anyone here do Georgist econometrics?
23:03 <moriarty> jmalicki, we do bitcoin econometrics XD
23:03 <jmalicki> anyone know of a retail broker that is planning on allowing short positions?
23:03 <jmalicki> interactivebrokers won't
23:03 <jmalicki> RandomCouch you should fund it with an ICO
23:04 <moriarty> jmalicki, short positions for XBT futures?
23:04 <RandomCouch> jmalicki, I plan to
23:04 <jmalicki> moriarty yes
23:05 <moriarty> jmalicki, well, i'm not surprised, did you see IB's open letter?
23:05 <jmalicki> moriarty no
23:07 <jmalicki> here's a pdf https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/11-IB17-1145-tp-letter-to-futures-trading-commission.pdf
23:08 <jmalicki> RandomCouch you're supposed to do an ICO then abscond to panama
23:09 <moriarty> jmalicki, cheers for the PDF
23:12 <jmalicki> the cool thing about XBT futures is that bitcoin people are going to discover the power of fractional reserve banking to multiply money
23:12 <jmalicki> meaning practically XBT will not be limited by proof of work anymore
23:12 <jmalicki> and can gave inflation
23:14 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol! what?
23:15 <moriarty> jmalicki, are you saying XBT futures will jump through the roof?
23:15 <jmalicki> moriarty sort of like mortgage debt in 2007....
23:15 <jmalicki> moriarty no, i mean suddenly there will be like 10x the supply of bitcoin
23:15 <jmalicki> moriarty when you suddenly increase the supply, which direction do you expect prices to go?
23:15 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol!
23:15 <jmalicki> like the number of *actual* bitcoin will be the same
23:16 <jmalicki> but you can buy XTC futures or actual bitcoin to get exposure, which means you're increasing the supply of instruments that can supply the exposure
23:17 <jmalicki> or you can buy XBT futures w/ leverage
23:20 <jmalicki> and there is also now a way to short it
23:20 <moriarty> jmalicki, i reckon the market will go haywire near close time
23:20 <jmalicki> before there wasn't a good practical way
23:21 <jmalicki> moriarty yeah it will probably be very manipulable for a time, but i do expect people will figure that out eventually and solve the issue
23:21 <jmalicki> like eventually market actors will put enough money into that such that the profits from price manipulation are small
23:22 <jmalicki> although that might mean market makers need to own large amounts of actual bitcoin
23:22 <moriarty> jmalicki, but how can market actors be naive given that they're mostly prop traders?
23:23 <moriarty> btw, ucb, jmalicki, https://qz.com/1149861/bitcoin-futures-akuna-capital-could-be-the-first-to-trade-cboes-new-cryptocurrency-derivative/
23:24 <jmalicki> i've heard Citadel also has a desk doing bitcoin
23:24 <jmalicki> or was at least seriously looking into it
23:24 <jmalicki> like having people actually work on it
23:27 <jmalicki> .... so grayscale doesn't just buy more bitcoin and short the security ?!?
23:28 <jmalicki> but like, *why doesn't grayscale fix it and make more money?!??!*
23:28 <moriarty> jmalicki, indeed
23:28 <jmalicki> do they not know how ETFs work?
23:28 <jmalicki> ossifrage if they buy bitcoin and short gbtc and continue eventually it evens out
23:28 <jmalicki> like that's literally how etfs work
23:30 <jmalicki> yes, and normally grayscale would fix that by selling more shares and using the proceeds to buy more actual btc, if they were run like any sane ETF
23:30 <jmalicki> if they are overvalued the amount they're overvalued is pure profit
23:30 <jmalicki> and increasing the quantity of shares means they get higher management fees
23:31 <jmalicki> " The Trust issues Baskets of Shares to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis in exchange for bitcoins that are deposited for safekeeping with the Custodian (as defined below)."
23:31 <jmalicki> so i could just make a ton of money by buying bitcoins and transfering them?
23:32 <jmalicki> i guess there is a lot of legal risk allowing your bitcoin to be held by their custodian
23:32 <jmalicki> so the price premium probably reflects a market probability estimate that grayscale is going to steal your bitcoin
23:32 <jmalicki> lose it, etc
23:33 <jmalicki> i assume that is sarcasm?
23:34 <jmalicki> it sounds over the top, but then again so is McAfee
23:35 <jmalicki> wait, XBT goes live on *Sunday*?
23:39 <jmalicki> crazy how different the markets are
23:39 <jmalicki> whats the spread?
23:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, about $800 from first glance
23:40 <jmalicki> oh man....
23:40 <jmalicki> i should screwing around with equities and start hft on bitcoin
23:40 <jmalicki> stop screwing
23:40 <jmalicki> this looks like a goldmine
23:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, of course, everyone's jumping on the bitcoin gravvy train
23:41 <jmalicki> it's clear everyone isn't with spreads like that
23:41 <jmalicki> i never got around to it before; just starting up a firm now
23:41 <jmalicki> psuedo hft
23:42 <jmalicki> real HFT is an extremely regulated beast and need some profits to finance FINRA membership etc etc
23:56 <moriarty> jmalicki, indeed, not to mention an expensive outlay
23:57 <jmalicki> moriarty  nah, you can generate most of the profits with a relatively small amount of capital
23:58 <jmalicki> as a rate of return the profits are huge, there are just diminishing returns to scale
23:58 <jmalicki> (in terms of amount of capital invested)
23:58 <jmalicki> to scale well is when you really need to worry about FPGAs and microwave links
00:01 <jmalicki> i'm curious to see what the spreads will be like
01:32 <jmalicki> :)
01:32 <jmalicki> ziper it's a "currency" that costs $22 to change hands...

01:19 <jmalicki> steve bannon is satoshi
19:58 <jmalicki> grill it's not a place for substantive conversation, it's a place for talking about cryptocurrency, which is basically never substantive
20:03 <jmalicki> is there a channel for people to talk about econometrics?
20:04 <jmalicki> thought so
20:06 <jmalicki> what is a "want" for more value?
20:07 <jmalicki> there's like a million ways of interpreting that to wildly different ends
20:08 <jmalicki> grill one big thing for *any* coin is that if it doesn't have much value, it's easily manipulable
20:09 <jmalicki> Brie_ how do you figure?
20:11 <jmalicki> grill like the less value there is, the more it's trivial for a big player to come in and steal money from other participants
20:12 <jmalicki> some newer coins are arguably *more* resistant to this than bitcoin at any given market cap, but that doesn't make the problem go away completely
20:23 <jmalicki> dispersed i fail to see where left vs. right handed is discussed at all in that article?
20:24 <jmalicki> it's only discussing right-to-left vs left-to-right languages...
20:24 <jmalicki> GenteelBen now you have
20:25 <cryptotrash> jmalicki you actually read it
20:25 <jmalicki> cryptotrash skimmed but yes
20:25 <jmalicki> it's only a couple pages
20:26 <jmalicki> i also read lots of computational linguistics so it's easy for me to skim
23:01 <jmalicki> "<bulaia> when rent for a 3br 2ba house is $6000 USD/month, shit is out of hand" can you tell me where you found this cheap rent?  Agreed it's out of hand, rents must be plummeting
23:02 <jmalicki> asm you've found closets for $1000?
23:09 <jmalicki> cryptotrash best for what?
23:10 <jmalicki> cryptotrash sausalito, lafayette, moraga, burlingame, palo alto, woodside, atherton, hillsborough are all contenders depending on how you define it
23:10 <jmalicki> cryptotrash atherton is probably the most expensive?
23:11 <jmalicki> cryptotrash in palo alto $250k/yr qualifies you for public housing assistance
23:11 <jmalicki> cryptotrash yep serious

23:12 <moriarty> lol jmalicki
23:13 <jmalicki> cryptotrash palo alto is probably the most expensive *for what you get*, the other places are expensive because they're all mansions
23:13 <jmalicki> well like atherton and hillsborough
23:13 <jmalicki> cryptotrash in the bay area mortgages are usually *waaay* more expensive than rent
23:14 <jmalicki> cryptotrash SF rents have come down quite a bit over the past year
23:14 <jmalicki> bay area in general
23:14 <jmalicki> especially at the top of the market
23:14 <jmalicki> notmike lol right
23:15 <jmalicki> cryptotrash you can get a studio in the tenderloin for under $2k
23:15 <jmalicki> it's a really colorful neighborhood, lots to do
23:15 <jmalicki> cryptotrash not suburb
23:16 <jmalicki> cryptotrash you can get your heroin right outside of your doorstep, along with some used needles left on the street
23:16 <jmalicki> and plenty of entertainment and people watching
23:16 <jmalicki> the entire sidewalk also doubles as a public restroom!

23:17 <jmalicki> notmike heroin is pretty big in the loin
23:18 <jmalicki> notmike i work at 6th and market and see probably half a dozen syringes a day
23:18 <jmalicki> cryptotrash we also have $20 cups of coffee
23:19 <jmalicki> http://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/The-20-cup-of-coffee-is-here-8239944.php
23:21 <jmalicki> now you have fentanyl too
23:24 <jmalicki> cryptotrash no idea never had the $20 coffee
23:26 <jmalicki> cryptotrash that's probably why it's so expensive, hard to grow coffee in the desert
23:27 <jmalicki> cryptotrash wine from the desert tastes a lot better the same might apply
23:28 <jmalicki> cryptotrash buy at $0
23:28 <jmalicki> or have someone pay you to buy bitcoin
23:29 <jmalicki> normies are market making, not hodling
00:25 <jmalicki> bobke they have a high rate of fatality
02:47 <jmalicki> terminus do they *enforce* it being publicly accessible?
02:47 <jmalicki> johntramp no
02:47 <jmalicki> johntramp money does not actually grow on trees
02:48 <Terminus> jmalicki: i wouldn't know but i think so. they require you to sign up to be given access to it and ask for a URL at that time. their FAQ says they ask for a URL again once dev is done.
02:49 <jmalicki> terminus so create two sites, one public and dumb, then your real site
02:51 <johntramp> jmalicki:  ah is that because we use plastic money now
02:52 <jmalicki> and cotton which grows on bushes not trees!
02:57 <jmalicki> weedcoin?
02:58 <jmalicki> oh wait that already exists
03:38 <jmalicki> louipc yep, broken windows do wonder for the economy
03:38 <louipc> jmalicki: yes
03:38 <jmalicki> notmike breaking windows is the best way to stimulate the economy
03:39 <jmalicki> notmike that's more about arresting people for breaking windows...

03:42 <jmalicki> bulaia that's why there's so much crime on teh int3rwebs
03:42 <jmalicki> if everyone just used openbsd we wouldn't have these problems
03:43 <jmalicki> yeah... it makes sure people can't figure out how to get on the internet so they won't have these problems ;P
03:44 <jmalicki> louipc in san francisco if you don't have enough on your ticket for exit fare you can only deposit cash, and only $1s, $5s and quarters
03:45 <jmalicki> if you have a $20 you're sol
03:45 <jmalicki> exactly
03:45 <jmalicki> it's just assinine
03:45 <jmalicki> like how hard is it to accept $20s?
04:31 <jmalicki> So what is the mandate?
04:32 <jmalicki> latentprion: in the us the mandate is to regulate interstate commerce
04:32 <latentprion> jmalicki: NO. That is the ICC (interstate commerce commission), a regulatory body set up BY congress to act on its behalf
04:33 <jmalicki> Umm wat?
04:33 <jmalicki> latentprion: the us constitution spells out the mandate clearly
04:33 <latentprion> jmalicki: ...and where in that mandate is the ICC?
04:34 <jmalicki> latentprion: article I section 8 clause 3
04:36 <jmalicki> Latentprion as am i
04:36 <jmalicki> Latentprion that is not an amendment
04:37 <jmalicki> Latentprion but Congress still has the mandate to do *whatever it wants*
04:37 <latentprion> jmalicki: that's utter nonsense and completely untrue
04:37 <jmalicki> By Article I Section 8 Clause 3
04:38 <jmalicki> Latentprion that clause gives Congress unlimited power
04:41 <jmalicki> latentprion:  I propose we modify it to take rich people's money
04:47 <jmalicki> Latentprion the us is not a society where people love liberty.
04:47 <latentprion> jmalicki: Moreso than others yes, but you're also right
04:47 <jmalicki> latentprion:  Somalia is a society where people love liberty
04:48 <latentprion> jmalicki: Somalia is not a private property law society
04:48 <jmalicki> Latentprion yes it is
04:48 <latentprion> jmalicki: "Yes it is" is not an argument
04:48 <jmalicki> Read more bout it
04:50 <jmalicki> https://mises.org/library/stateless-somalia-and-loving-it
04:51 <jmalicki> Latentprion there is already Somalia
04:51 <latentprion> jmalicki: Idk which part of "Somalia is not free market / libertarian" you didn't understand
04:52 <jmalicki> Latentprion I already posted the data
04:52 <jmalicki> Maybe you could actually learn more about Somalia
04:52 <jmalicki> Rather than parroting communist lies
04:52 <louipc> jmalicki: hes not proposing no government, just some weirdo republic
04:52 <jmalicki> Article above
04:53 <jmalicki> Read.
04:53 <latentprion> what are you trying to ask me to do, jmalicki ?
04:53 <jmalicki> To read
04:54 <jmalicki> No, to learn about it before making claims
04:57 <jmalicki> latentprion: so liberty stops if you use violence to prevent someone from stealing your property?
04:57 <jmalicki> Louipc how do you know?
04:57 <latentprion> jmalicki: I'm sure you knew that was a silly question before you asked it.
04:57 <louipc> jmalicki: its human nature. the losers will always try to drag the winners down
04:58 <jmalicki> latentprion: I want to know what you're proposing precisely
04:58 <louipc> jmalicki: and the winners will always try to protect themselves
04:58 <jmalicki> So these questions are worth asking to clearly delineate
04:58 <latentprion> jmalicki: How many times do I have to type "private property law"
04:58 <jmalicki> latentprion: if you don't precisely define it, infinity
04:59 <jmalicki> That sounds like communism
05:00 <latentprion> jmalicki: I want you to step back and think about what you just said
05:00 <jmalicki> Latentprion so if you hire me to build you a house I own the house?
05:00 <xissburg> jmalicki wat
05:00 <jmalicki> After all it's the product of my labor
05:00 <latentprion> jmalicki: If you voluntarily contracted to give away the produce of your labour, then you no longer own the thing that you just VOLUNTARILY contracted to GIVE AWAY
05:00 <latentprion> jmalicki: Please
05:00 <jmalicki> Ok see, that's a new constraint
05:01 <jmalicki> latentprion: I do, it's the product by of my labor, I can't sell it
05:01 <jmalicki> I own it, as you said
05:01 <xissburg> jmalicki why did you build it?
05:02 <jmalicki> xissburg:  because latentprion paid for the materials of my new free house
05:02 <xissburg> jmalicki but there's a contract
05:02 <jmalicki> Xissburg noone said anything about contracts yet
05:02 <jmalicki> This needs defining
05:03 <xissburg> jmalicki contract says you build the house, you get paid some bitcoins, then you GTFO
05:03 <jmalicki> Xissburg noone said contracts are enforceable yet
05:03 <jmalicki> We need to decide that
05:04 <jmalicki> Xissburg the contract had invisible ink that latentprion couldn't see that said I get the house
05:05 <xissburg> jmalicki take it to the (private) courts
05:05 <jmalicki> xissburg: so what legal principles should they use to decide?
05:05 <xissburg> jmalicki private property
05:06 <jmalicki> xissburg: that is insufficient, it says nothing about invisible ink in contracts
05:06 <xissburg> jmalicki that'll need an investigation
05:06 <jmalicki> xissburg buy what are the principles here regarding the legality?
05:06 <xissburg> jmalicki btw.. why use ink.. when you can use smart contracts
05:07 <xissburg> jmalicki private property
05:07 <jmalicki> xissburg because then latentprion would be aware of what he is signing
05:07 <jmalicki> xissburg that is again insufficient
05:08 <jmalicki> xissburg can latentprion  sign away his house when the contract contained language he did not see?
05:08 <jmalicki> What does "private property" say here?
05:09 <latentprion> jmalicki: I understand that your question is not directed at me, but I'll just point out to you that the wording makes it impossible for me to understand that quesker
05:10 <jmalicki> Latentprion hidden in the contract for me to build your house is invisible ink that says I get the house when finished
05:10 <xissburg> jmalicki I gotta poop
05:10 <jmalicki> Whose house is it?
05:10 <latentprion> jmalicki: Contracts have several properties: offer, consideration, terms, consent and acceptance
05:11 <jmalicki> Got it
05:11 <jmalicki> Louipc no it's not
05:12 <jmalicki> louipc: this is *exactly* the slippery slope towards statism
05:13 <jmalicki> So now we need to find the limits of duress
05:13 <latentprion> jmalicki: No
05:13 <jmalicki> louipc:  but that wasn't latentprion's answer
05:13 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, and that's the slope of statism
05:13 <louipc> jmalicki: i dunno maybe we talking about different things
05:14 <louipc> jmalicki: i feel robbed of my time and attention from an idiot
05:19 <jmalicki> Latentprion the history of the US supreme Court "modifying" the constitution is mostly finding more complicated reasons people couldn't consent to a contract
05:20 <jmalicki> Yes
05:21 <jmalicki> latentprion: look at say roe v wade
05:26 <jmalicki> Well it's a little different
05:26 <jmalicki> But still about the basic rights that can be restricted etc
05:26 <jmalicki> General principles are very vague
05:27 <jmalicki> The trend has to been to move closer to statism the more akward weird questions come up
05:27 <jmalicki> Well maybe
05:27 <jmalicki> Or the private courts slowly strip it away
05:27 <jmalicki> Can an impoverished person truly consent to their lease?
05:27 <latentprion> jmalicki: ...yes
05:28 <jmalicki> Some might say no
05:28 <jmalicki> Some do say no
05:28 <jmalicki> You have the right to not sign a contract with clauses in invisible ink
05:29 <jmalicki> Latentprion what if there is only one available job within 50 miles?
05:29 <latentprion> jmalicki: your current income level is not one of the components of a contract
05:29 <jmalicki> As often happens
05:29 <jmalicki> latentprion neither is your inability to read invisible ink
05:30 <jmalicki> Latentprion is you will starve if you don't sign is that consent?
05:30 <jmalicki> If
05:30 <jmalicki> Exactly
05:30 <jmalicki> Many others disagrre
05:30 <jmalicki> latentprion what other options? There is one employer with open jobs
05:31 <jmalicki> Why?
05:31 <jmalicki> Maybe you and I are the only people within commuting distance
05:31 <jmalicki> So I work for you or not at all
05:31 <jmalicki> What if you also own all the land?
05:32 <jmalicki> Locally
05:32 <jmalicki> I have a lease
05:32 <jmalicki> Yes
05:32 <jmalicki> Exactly
05:32 <jmalicki> Yes
05:33 <jmalicki> Now you give me a new employment contract
05:33 <jmalicki> Cutting my wages
05:33 <latentprion> jmalicki: So either accept or reject
05:33 <jmalicki> Latentprion many many would argue I cannot consent
05:34 <jmalicki> So you need clear principles to explain why this is not fraud but invisible ink is not
05:34 <jmalicki> I can't get out of your land, u have a lease obligation
05:34 <jmalicki> I not u
05:34 <latentprion> jmalicki: fraud is offering somebody X, but giving them X-1 instead
05:34 <jmalicki> latentprion: yes.. like this
05:35 <jmalicki> Yes, but you did not tell me you word force a new employment contract on me
05:35 <jmalicki> Would not word
05:35 <jmalicki> Many courts disagree
05:35 <jmalicki> US courts consider this just as much fraud as the invisible ink
05:36 <jmalicki> Because you said the gun would not be permitted
05:36 <jmalicki> It is very very hard to come up with a universal definition of consent
05:37 <jmalicki> Which is where most of the things people think they're disagreeing about other things come from
05:37 <jmalicki> latentprion: yes, so this was not consent ez pz
05:37 <jmalicki> It was a contract of adhesion
05:38 <jmalicki> That is the violence
05:38 <jmalicki> Latentprion one where the consequences for me to refuse the contract are higher than for yoy
05:38 <jmalicki> Courts consider that violence
05:39 <jmalicki> They don't *start* out statist
05:39 <jmalicki> They are only applying your broad principles differently
05:39 <jmalicki> Latentprion I don't get the wage you would pay
05:39 <jmalicki> Yes and not having that is violence
05:40 <jmalicki> According to actual courts who apply your principles
05:40 <jmalicki> So if you dislike that, you need more than those basic principles
05:40 <jmalicki> And need a state with very explicit statutes and laws noone can understand
05:41 <jmalicki> Which is where the state comes after you with its guns
05:41 <jmalicki> Ok so then I just kill you and take your land
05:42 <jmalicki> Noone stops it
05:42 <jmalicki> So then we have anarchy and feudalism not private property
05:43 <jmalicki> That's exactly my point
05:43 <jmalicki> This stuff is hard
05:43 <latentprion> jmalicki: Within a sufficiently isolated scope, there is always anarchy
05:43 <jmalicki> A government that can't prevent me from just killing you and taking your land is hardly a government
05:44 <jmalicki> Yes but it's not normal everyday behavior
05:44 <jmalicki> It's the state failing
05:44 <jmalicki> +even if temporariky)
05:44 <jmalicki> Well, it is temporarily failing
05:44 <latentprion> jmalicki: Then anarchy reigns in every home whenever a man kills his wife
05:45 <jmalicki> Yes
05:45 <jmalicki> Yes
05:45 <latentprion> jmalicki: right
05:45 <jmalicki> The state was not sufficiently present
05:45 <jmalicki> Which is why the uk has cameras everywhere and monitors everyone
05:46 <jmalicki> There are also usually later consequences
05:46 <jmalicki> Yes
05:46 <jmalicki> But ultimately issues around consent are often thorny
05:47 <jmalicki> What is obviously consent to *you* isn't necessarily agreed upon by others
05:47 <jmalicki> That again isn't universal
05:48 <jmalicki> Yes but then we're again without protected property rights
05:48 <jmalicki> That's called feudalism
05:49 <latentprion> I see what you're saying, but jmalicki at some level, everything in this world is violence or labour
05:49 <jmalicki> Latentprion yeah, these things are just fragile
05:50 <jmalicki> Precisely defining the abstractions in weird circumstances is where basically all the complications come in
05:50 <jmalicki> Where all
05:51 <jmalicki> And why things get out of hand  over time
05:57 <jmalicki> Latentprion and this is how you have federal courts deciding if Snuggies are blankets or sweaters

16:41 jmalicki (sid101323@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-oeppyevrbjftkosc) has joined ##econometrics
21:09 <jmalicki> moriarty all of the people I know from AQR say they're discretionary not fully automated.. has that changed?
21:09 <jmalicki> like quant driven, but very human in the loop
21:10 <jmalicki> i guess they do have some "smart beta" stuff now that's less discretionary, but probably little advantage to full automation there
21:11 <moriarty> jmalicki, in the wider circles, people tend to be more free with the terms :) so it gets overlap a lot
21:11 <jmalicki> oh, towards the bottom here there are good numbers for hft, you rarely get to see them but for australian regulation http://www.automatedtrader.net/articles/strategies/156131/hacking-korea-the-accidental-hft-firm
21:12 <jmalicki> moriarty i definitely have gotten the impression citadel is closer to being automated quant than aqr
21:12 <jmalicki> but could be wrong based on bias of what people i know
21:12 <jmalicki> like citadel will chase pure science phds much more than aqr
21:13 <jmalicki> aqr still likes finance people like traditional asset management
21:13 <moriarty> jmalicki, good point, may well depend on the person's interests, to be fair, most of the times, they get lumped in the same bag
21:14 <jmalicki> i am basing from my first and second hand interctions mostly which could not be representative
21:14 <jmalicki> there's also tons of HF peons :)
21:15 <jmalicki> i don't know that AQR does much high frequency stuff at all?
21:15 <jmalicki> like there's little benefit to full automation when you trade quarterly
21:16 <jmalicki> two sigma citadel etc. are getting into traditional asset management as they've made too much money to throw back into hft
21:16 <jmalicki> even venture capital now for both of them!!!!
21:17 <moriarty> jmalicki, yeah i agree, high frequency stuff was all the rage back in 2000s, but these days i've been seeing them with a little less frequency, i suppose the markets eventually got saturated at a point
21:17 <jmalicki> moriarty but still highly highly profitable as those australian numbers show above
21:17 <jmalicki> just not big enough to throw 10 figures at
21:18 <jmalicki> gears to be rational, it probably doesn't make sense to do much outside of an index fund until you get into the high 6 figures saved, maybe even 7, as it takes too much effort to do well
21:19 <jmalicki> unless you're trying to become educated and considering your underperformance to be "tuition" of a sort
21:20 <jmalicki> yuriwho every 0 you add limits options more :)
21:20 <jmalicki> in 9-10 figures it's really hard to look different than an index fund
21:21 <jmalicki> like, you can't pick which stocks to invest in at that point, only which stocks to *not* invest in as you're invested by defaut
21:21 <jmalicki> or even just underweight
21:22 <jmalicki> wow AQR has $224bn
21:22 <jmalicki> gears economically rational says put it into an index fund, otherwise you should consider it like a second job, and wonder if it's worth the hours put in
21:22 <jmalicki> or if you want to become educated for long term it can be useful, but don't fool yourself into thinking there's a likely payout
21:23 <jmalicki> gears lets say you have $10k, and get a great 40% return
21:23 <jmalicki> gears which is $4k, or 6 months of working a minimum wage job half time
21:24 <contrapumpkin> jmalicki: it's not all in a single fund though, afaik
21:24 <jmalicki> if you can do better than minimum wage, it becomes even less appealing
21:24 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin yeah but there *overall* holdings have to be approaching index funds
21:24 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin it's like different departments playing greater fool against each other
21:25 <jmalicki> but that's what customers will pay for :)
21:25 <jmalicki> yuriwho that's almost a tautology ;P
21:25 <jmalicki> yuriwho like index funds represent the collective performance of all mutual and hedge funds before fees
21:26 <jmalicki> so they have to on average underperform after fees
21:26 <jmalicki> but bridgewater is still *huge* and manages to consistently outperform
21:28 <jmalicki> smart beta is great if you're investing taxable money, but makes little sense for retirement
21:28 <jmalicki> (a lot of funds can get 1% alpha just by avoiding dividends)
21:33 <jmalicki> python476 i don't *right now* but i usually do
21:33 <jmalicki> i like multiscreen better than one bigscreen because it makes managing multiple windows easier
21:33 <jmalicki> like you just maximize on each screen
21:33 <jmalicki> and don't have to fiddle
21:34 <jmalicki> i suppose a good window manager could do that, but why pay more for a bigger screen to emulate two smaller ones?
21:34 <jmalicki> python476 https://www.timothysykes.com/blog/check-out-this-cool-multi-monitor-trading-setup-photo/
21:35 <jmalicki> (sorry for linking to such a horrible site)
21:50 <jmalicki> Wegg shitty power supply?
21:50 <jmalicki> python476 most gpus are smart enough to self-power-down in the face of inadequate cooling
21:51 <jmalicki> (i got missed that mine's point for doing so was in excess of 100C, which... is shitty for mostly-water-based liquid cooling)
21:51 <Wegg> jmalicki: power supply is awesome. . . it was just an old old card being cooked 24/7 for months on end.
21:51 <jmalicki> like why 105C? is that really better than 100C?
21:51 <jmalicki> Wegg something is still shitty
21:52 <python476> jmalicki: unless they spill !
21:52 <jmalicki> solid state electronics should not suffer from "excess use"
21:52 <jmalicki> like it means some capacitor bank is screwed up
21:53 <jmalicki> Wegg have you tried to get it covered with warranty?
22:03 <jmalicki> yuriwho yes to gpu heating systems... if you're in a cold climate yoru effective electricity cost gets way cheaper
22:03 <jmalicki> (since you're not paying for other sources of heat)
22:03 <jmalicki> (or air conditioning)
22:03 <python476> jmalicki: I never considered that GPU would be more efficient than conventional heaters
22:03 <jmalicki> python476 it's not
22:04 <jmalicki> python476 it's as efficient as any conventional *electric* heater
22:04 <jmalicki> python476 if it's not adiabatic, all of the logic eventually becomes heat
22:04 <python476> jmalicki: you heard of landauer theory ?
22:05 <jmalicki> python476 no?
22:05 <jmalicki> python476 yes, that's now called adiabatic computing
22:06 <jmalicki> but it's basically theoretical
22:06 <jmalicki> in practice your computer doesn't measurably benefit from that
22:07 <jmalicki> python476 unsurprisingly it's a reasonably active research area
22:07 <jmalicki> sweetbabyjesus it's a theory that says it's possible for anything else to happen
22:07 <jmalicki> just becoming heat is the default
22:08 <jmalicki> right now they're basically 0% efficient :)
22:08 <jmalicki> well no
22:08 <jmalicki> sweetbabyjesus physics is hard.
22:08 <jmalicki> sweetbabyjesus like *maybe* in a *decade* we might have an efficient two bit computer
22:09 <jmalicki> like this is the edge of theoretical physics just becoming experimental
22:39 <jmalicki> moriarty you mean news affects bitcoin price?
22:39 <jmalicki> that seems... unsurprising?
22:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol
22:40 <jmalicki> Wegg the nice thing is if you follow logic and are aware enough to get out of the teenage girl's way, great rewards lie
22:40 <moriarty> i found it interesting the markets barely reacted to the news, jmalicki
22:40 <jmalicki> moriarty you mean bitcoin or equity?
22:41 <jmalicki> ah
22:41 <jmalicki> moriarty hmm it seems like tether is so obviously a scam that news probably won't affect things
22:41 <jmalicki> like if you were open to facts you would probably have avoided it to begin with
22:41 <jmalicki> or at least the likely scamminess came out *very* early
22:42 <jmalicki> moriarty they claim to be like eurodollars
22:42 <jmalicki> moriarty i mean even from november https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-bitfinex-dilemma-blow-up-now-or-try-a-hail-mary-to-retain-in-business-10b9d989359f
22:43 <jmalicki> moriarty no i mean, all of bitfinex's claims about tether and how it works are highly incredulous
22:43 <jmalicki> like ok, if they're backed by dollars, those dollars must exist somewhere, right?
22:44 <jmalicki> blop it moves over time
22:44 <jmalicki> blop and depending on assumptions about hardware existing etc
22:44 <moriarty> jmalicki, true
22:50 <jmalicki> blop could be... but conventional wisdom is that most bitcoin miners have to have super cheap or subsidized electricity
22:50 <jmalicki> blop e.g. perhaps most miners are hydroelectric power companies in china
22:51 <jmalicki> blop also, you get bitcoin in addition to a transaction fee
22:52 <moriarty> jmalicki, the way i understand it, the dollars are parked in a bank only known to tether, and they come by way of kraken
22:53 <jmalicki> blop so for estimating the likelihood of bitcoin becoming a popular way to transact, how much power would it take to say, power 1% of USD transactions?
22:53 <jmalicki> moriarty that is the *claim*
22:53 <moriarty> jmalicki, seems reasonable to me
22:53 <jmalicki> moriarty the numbers  are large enough, and it is being created with ,that it seems probably
22:53 <jmalicki> improbable
22:53 <jmalicki> moriarty ok, where are they getting $100m/wk in cash?
22:53 <jmalicki> it must *come from somewhere*, right?
22:54 <jmalicki> blop there are tons of ways around it, bitcoin is not one of them...
22:54 <moriarty> jmalicki, from margin deposits
22:54 <jmalicki> if crypto will succeed it can't be bitcoin
22:55 <moriarty> jmalicki, all tether in circulation tends to flow towards traders who margin trade with USDT to buy cryptos, keeping an equivalent in USD on his trading account
23:01 <jmalicki> moriarty that would make sense *if it was possible to deposit usd into bitfinex*
23:01 <jmalicki> but that is broken
23:01 <jmalicki> and disabled
23:01 <jmalicki> if someone was *able to deposit usd*, that story could make sense
23:01 <jmalicki> moriarty that does not mean bitfinex gets dollars
23:02 <jmalicki> moriarty through which mechanism?
23:02 <jmalicki> moriarty somehow a dollar has to go to tether through the banking system
23:02 <jmalicki> moriarty they claim to be
23:02 <jmalicki> if tether does not have a claim on that dollar, it's a scam
23:03 <jmalicki> moriarty yep, tether does not have that dollar
23:03 <jmalicki> and is thus a ponzi scheme
23:03 <jmalicki> moriarty you are describing the problem with it well, and why it's a ponzi scheme
23:04 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin tether claims to be backed by dollars.
23:04 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin so, yes, in fact, they are offering guaranteed returns of exactly 0%
23:04 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin but they can't back the 0% returns
23:05 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin the case of tether is not an overuse.
23:05 <jmalicki> moriarty wrong - it CLAIMS to be a one-to-one backing
23:05 <jmalicki> if it is not, it is a ponzi scheme
23:05 <jmalicki> moriarty that is not their claim.
23:06 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol tether is no different from bitcoin :)
23:06 <jmalicki> moriarty bitcoin does not claim to be backed by dollars
23:06 <jmalicki> moriarty i'm saying *it's not*
23:06 <jmalicki> moriarty what you described *is not that*
23:07 <jmalicki> moriarty if your story is true, bitfinex is about to go bust
23:07 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol no it's not
23:08 <jmalicki> hmm i can short tether on kraken i should do so
23:09 <jmalicki> moriarty if you believe what you say, you have infinite guaranteed 1.2% returns you can flip
23:09 <jmalicki> or that could be a good idea anyway
23:09 <jmalicki> since that doesn't depend on long term results
23:09 <jmalicki> nope
23:10 <jmalicki> i am only focusing on 'backed by dollars'
23:10 <jmalicki> moriarty that isn't true, you're underthinking what bitfinex claims
23:10 <jmalicki> moriarty bitcoin makes no such claim
23:11 <jmalicki> moriarty https://tether.to/
23:11 <jmalicki> "Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD."
23:11 <jmalicki> that is the tether claim
23:11 <jmalicki> not in your story, since the USD deposited into kraken never went to tether
23:12 <jmalicki> moriarty fraud
23:12 <jmalicki> if it is not a fraud, there must be some way that USD went to tether's bank account
23:14 <jmalicki> i'm saying there is no evidence *they receive funds*
23:15 <jmalicki> moriarty they would have to receive funds from somewhere.. since they no longer accept usd deposits, then where?
23:15 <as2333> jmalicki, magc?
23:16 <jmalicki> as2333 that sort of magic is called a ponzi scheme
23:17 <jmalicki> moriarty all of the concern about bitfinex is about *whether it is true that they actually receive funds in exchange for tether*
23:17 <moriarty> jmalicki, they no longer accept usd deposits for reasons of privacy i believe
23:18 <jmalicki> moriarty sure... but it takes away the easiest story for how they relieve funds
23:18 <jmalicki> receive, freudian slip
23:18 <jmalicki> moriarty could be, but who is sending it?
23:18 <jmalicki> kraken?
23:19 <moriarty> jmalicki, yep
23:20 <jmalicki> moriarity they could expose that fact w/o exposing their bank account
23:20 <moriarty> jmalicki, we can always look at it in reverse
23:21 <jmalicki> moriarty you mean the tether bitfinex gave out because they didn't have enough cash to replace hacked accounts?
23:21 <jmalicki> arij claim to.
23:21 <moriarty> jmalicki, those weren't tether were they?
23:21 <jmalicki> arij the question is if they're bald faced lie
23:21 <moriarty> those were BFX tokens, jmalicki
23:22 <moriarty> jmalicki, just to help clear things up
23:22 <jmalicki> moriarty yeah, but they created value out of thin air
23:22 <arij> jmalicki: you dont know that
23:22 <jmalicki> moriarty yes, but *related* entities
23:22 <jmalicki> arij it is occam's razor
23:23 <jmalicki> woah boom, here it is https://www.coindesk.com/report-cftc-sends-subpoenas-bitfinex-tether/
23:23 <jmalicki> here the fun starts
23:24 <contrapumpkin> jmalicki: that's what we've been talking about for the past few hours isn't it?
23:24 <jmalicki> contrapumpkin i hadn't seen that particular update
23:24  * jmalicki was unaware
23:24 <jmalicki> so i suppose we're close to truth at this point
23:24 <contrapumpkin> jmalicki:
23:24 <jmalicki> aah
23:25 <jmalicki> peter2r that's very much an econometrics q
23:25 <jmalicki> peter2r what's your q?
23:26 <jmalicki> peter2r i'm confused, poisson doesn't have a dispersion parameter?
23:26 <peter2r> jmalicki: Well, I could introduce one :)
23:26 <jmalicki> peter2r yes, but it's not poisson ;P
23:27 <peter2r> jmalicki: Well, strictly speaking no :D
23:27 <jmalicki> k
23:27 <jmalicki> peter2r so what's your q, how these two things are related?
23:28 <jmalicki> peter2r so this is the difference between coordinate-wise and joint estimation
23:28 <peter2r> jmalicki: Hm, can you elaborate?
23:29 <jmalicki> peter2r what you did was first assuming there was no overdispersion, then fit parameters, then calculated overdispersion
23:29 <jmalicki> peter2r to estimate both at once, you need to simultaneously do both
23:29 <jmalicki> peter2r or do it in a loop e.g. expectation-maximization, or majorization-minimization
23:29 <jmalicki> peter2r this is like the same difference between 2sls and gee
23:30 <peter2r> jmalicki: So essentially, it's wrong, when I try to adjust the standard errors like this?
23:30 <jmalicki> peter2r, it's "different" :)
23:30 <jmalicki> peter2r imo econometricians focus too much on "wrong" :)
23:30 <jmalicki> peter2r it's a fundamentally different estimator
23:31 <jmalicki> peter2r there is nothing wrong with estimating differently for convenience as long as you realize what you're doing
23:31 <jmalicki> peter2r so yours is easy to compute :)
23:31 <jmalicki> peter2r the one in R is more accurate :)
23:31 <jmalicki> peter2r yours is a biased estimator
23:32 <jmalicki> peter2r i can't quickly in my head think about how it changes
23:32 <jmalicki> yeah
23:32 <jmalicki> peter2r at least, given the assumptions of quasipoisson ;)
23:32 <peter2r> jmalicki: If I want to know what R does, how can I find out? Now I'm curious. I know it's open source, and I'm used to read code, but I don't know where to find the specific part of the source I need (where they estimate it).
23:33 <jmalicki> you could read the source
23:34 <jmalicki> peter2r just look at glm (i'm guessing that's what you're using?) and work your way down
23:35 <jmalicki> peter2r i've looked at the code before, iirc they do E-M
23:37 <jmalicki> oh n/m they don't need to
23:38 <peter2r> jmalicki: They don't need to estimate it?
23:40 <jmalicki> ya i was thinking of other code...
23:41 <peter2r> jmalicki: I was just wondering where the number came from :)
23:43 <jmalicki> peter2r... good.... question....
23:43 <jmalicki> the core team is quite nice and responsive
23:43 <jmalicki> much better than package authors
23:44 <jmalicki> just ask on the mailing list
23:48 <jmalicki> peter2r they're academics
23:48 <jmalicki> responding to students is what they do
23:48 <moriarty> jmalicki++
23:48 <jmalicki> peter2r no like, these guys are particularly nice
23:50 <jmalicki> peter2r i mean look, very helpful https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2018-January/thread.html
23:50 <jmalicki> it's a very large, nice, pleasant community
23:50 <jmalicki> peter2r but i can't see for the life of me where theta comes from, i must have been reading some other package when i saw em
23:51 <peter2r> jmalicki: Lots of questions and answers. Are these answered by the developers or some "random dudes"?
23:51 <jmalicki> peter2r both
23:51 <jmalicki> just ask
23:52 <jmalicki> also simon davies may be your man https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/a28e609e72ed7c47f6ddfbb86c85279a0750f0b7/src/library/stats/R/family.R#L46
23:52 <jmalicki> who'd a think a footballer wrote large parts of R
23:52 <jmalicki> wonder how he compares to John Urschel
23:53 <peter2r> jmalicki: Is he a footballer? :D
23:53 <jmalicki> peter2r that's what google says :)
23:53 <jmalicki> not possibe
23:58 <peter2r> jmalicki: I just found a paper where they are talking about something called "sandwich-adjusted Poisson" and quasi-Poisson. However, they do not define what they mean by sandwich-adjusted, so I'm wondering if that is what I did?
23:58 <jmalicki> peter2r usually sandwich estimates are just for variance?
23:58 <peter2r> jmalicki: Yeah

00:03 <jmalicki> peter2r so you should be able to loop
00:03 <jmalicki> peter2r use glm, estimate overdispersion, then pass that as scale=(), loop to convergence
00:03 <jmalicki> peter2r that is EM, it should get you the same results as quasipoisson
00:03 <peter2r> jmalicki: Oh, that's nice. I'll take a look :)
00:05 <peter2r> jmalicki: When they write "over-dispersed Poisson", do you think they mean "quasi-Poisson"?
00:05 <jmalicki> peter2r usually they're synonymous
00:05 <jmalicki> i mean there are other ways etc.
00:05 <jmalicki> but 99% of the time...
00:06 <jmalicki> peter2r well i mean all of these are for overdispersed
00:06 <jmalicki> quasi-poisson is the typical estimator
00:06 <jmalicki> and model
00:06 <jmalicki> is there a reason you don't want quasipoisson, or just curious?
00:06 <jmalicki> r's code is confusing, but i understand how it works *in general*
00:07 <peter2r> jmalicki: No, I'm basically trying to learn. So it's more for academic reasons :)
00:07 <jmalicki> peter2r so you can be more general
00:07 <jmalicki> peter2r let's say you have some distribution f(x|a,b)
00:08 <jmalicki> peter2r quasipoisson is estimating a and b at the same time
00:08 <jmalicki> peter2r you are estimating f(x|a, b=a)
00:08 <jmalicki> and estimating f(x|ahat, b)
00:08 <jmalicki> with ahat fixed
00:08 <jmalicki> that is different than doing both at once
00:09 <jmalicki> ya
00:09 <jmalicki> peter2r if you do that in a loop, and substitute b=bhat at the first, the you have E-M
00:09 <jmalicki> which will converge to the same result as both at once
00:09 <jmalicki> you just ping-pong between them
00:10 <jmalicki> plaerzen this *is* ##econometrics ;)
00:10 <jmalicki> peter2r i basically did sketch it ;)
00:10 <jmalicki> if for some reason joint estimation is hard
00:10 <jmalicki> there can be many reasons
00:11 <jmalicki> peter2r i am also being abusive, statisticians would call this in particular majorization/minimization, where ML people handwave away the difference ;P
00:11 <jmalicki> so i'll call it MM
00:11 <jmalicki> peter2r yes
00:12 <jmalicki> peter2r basically you partitition your parameters
00:12 <jmalicki> estimate a with b fixed, then b with a fixed, then a with b fixed, etc.
00:12 <jmalicki> until you converge
00:12 <jmalicki> and you can prove this procedure gives the correct answer
00:13 <jmalicki> peter2r dispersion/mu i think????
00:13 <jmalicki> peter2r i'd check to be sure exactly what is correct
00:13 <jmalicki> peter2r E-M is also how GLMM works
00:15 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm taking a course on statistical modelling as an elective course, so it's actually not really an econometrics class, but I think it's quite useful. We've been given a dataset with basically no instructions. Just "analyse this dataset using appropriate methods" or something :D
00:16 <jmalicki> peter2r https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/m_smmr97.pdf
00:18 <peter2r> Seems like an interesting paper, jmalicki :)
00:18 <jmalicki> peter2r be careful econometricians like for every single thing to be properly named etc., it's a very conservative field
00:18 <jmalicki> (compared to statistics or machine learning, etc)
00:18 <jmalicki> oh yes
00:19 <jmalicki> econometrics is way behind statistics ;P
00:19 <jmalicki> econometricians still care about unbiased estimators, statistics abandoned that crap 20 years ago
00:20 <jmalicki> (since stein's paradox, and especially now that it's well understood, statisticians well understand that there is almost always a biased estimator that is more accurate than the best unbiased estimator)
00:20 <jmalicki> thank you, Brad Efron
00:21 <jmalicki> i mean, not *all* of them
00:21 <jmalicki> but science advances one funeral at a time after all
00:22 <jmalicki> econometrics will just take an extra generation or so
00:24 <jmalicki> peter2r oh i was taking for granted from the other article that it took scale hrmm
00:24 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm not sure I can pass such an argument...
00:26 <jmalicki> peter2r oooh that's talking about stata...
00:27 <jmalicki> peter2r i'm guessing your parameter values are larger than what you get with quasipoisson, and your overdispersion is smaller?
00:28 <peter2r> jmalicki: Well, the parameter estimates are of course identical, but the standard errors are underestimated.
00:28 <jmalicki> peter2r oh, i'm very surprised that the parameter estimates are identical, that's not normally the case
00:29 <peter2r> jmalicki: I mean, the estimates of the regression parameters.
00:29 <jmalicki> yes
00:29 <jmalicki> that's not normal?
00:29 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm pretty sure it is.
00:29 <jmalicki> no, it's not
00:29 <jmalicki> it is usually quite different
00:31 <jmalicki> peter2r hmm ok it's possible it's still unbiased, but still shouldn't give same estimates on the same dataset
00:31 <jmalicki> but that still seems off...
00:32 <jmalicki> peter if that claim was true, your method would give the same answer.
00:32 <peter2r> jmalicki: Why not? You can try on any dataset, if you want. Even your own. I'm pretty sure you'll obtain the same estimates of β with Poisson and quasi-Poisson.
00:32 <jmalicki> peter2r if it was independent, you would see the same answer
00:33 <jmalicki> peter2r and also, given the way software works, there is no reason to do EM if independent
00:33 <peter2r> jmalicki: I do see the same answer for the parameter estimates.
00:33 <jmalicki> ah right
00:33 <jmalicki> peter2r but you would also get the same standard errors
00:33 <jmalicki> since they're *independent*
00:34 <jmalicki> oh, it's possible it doesn't depend on overdispersion as a linear parameter
00:34 <jmalicki> e.g. the entire second derivative matrix changes
00:36 <jmalicki> peter2fs so even like with heteroskedasticity beta isn't biased, but you regularly get different estimates due to lack of power
00:36 <jmalicki> it's very surprising you see no difference..
00:36 <jmalicki> (even if it's consistent)
00:37 <peter2r> jmalicki: Well, that holds for any dataset, I believe. I tried with several datasets and that seems to be a general pattern. If you have time, I suggest that you confirm this, if you are not convinced :)
00:37 <jmalicki> yeah, it's just really surprising
00:37 <jmalicki> that it works so robustly
00:38 <jmalicki> peter2r in general a different estimator being consistent for beta is very different than giving same answers...
00:41 <peter2r> jmalicki: https://pastebin.com/FstrUf5G
00:41 <jmalicki> i believe you, it's just really interesting
00:42 <jmalicki> i guess it makes sense
00:44 <peter2r> Try to see here, jmalicki
00:45 <jmalicki> these are all just claims, not proof
00:45 <jmalicki> but it seems to be true
00:46 <peter2r> jmalicki: But would you still suggest EM?
00:46 <jmalicki> it's utterly pointless in this case :)
00:46 <jmalicki> since there is no dependency
00:47 <peter2r> jmalicki: Yeah, but how could it be estimated then? :)
00:49 <jmalicki> peter2r with the information matrix as usual?
00:49 <jmalicki> this is good with full chain of citations https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b571/handouts/OverdispQL.pdf
00:50 <jmalicki> peter2r yeah i guess overdispersion is a special case, it really is independnet
00:50 <jmalicki> a lot of other things are consistent without being independent
00:51 <peter2r> jmalicki: Is the information matrix usually used to estimate the dispersion parameter?
00:51 <jmalicki> peter2r it's used to estimate the std. errors
00:51 <jmalicki> peter2r if the standard errors are different, the information matrix must be different
00:52 <jmalicki> peter2r so the total covariance has multiple components
00:52 <jmalicki> the variance of parameters, and the overall model variation
00:53 <jmalicki> (again, i'm clearly missing a lot as i don't work with overdispersion a lot)
00:55 <peter2r> jmalicki: So could you suggest a straightforward way to get the number from the summary? :)
00:59 <peter2r> jmalicki: Someone in ##statistics just suggested the same as you did.
00:59 <jmalicki> peter2r so it still can estimate the variance jointly
00:59 <jmalicki> which is *not* independent
01:00 <jmalicki> peter2r though hrmmf
01:01 <jmalicki> peter2r if Var(Y)=theta normalVar(Y)
01:01 <jmalicki> then the inverse should also be fine since  it's just a constant weird
01:01 <jmalicki> dunno this is getting deep, beyond what i know off the top of my head
01:02 <jmalicki> it's interesting and i want to know, but it's a distraction for now, this is at the top of my weekend reading since it's a common model i clearly know too little about
01:02 <peter2r> No problem, jmalicki. Thanks for your time and interest :)
01:04 <jmalicki> peter2r the uwash link is unusually good
01:05 <peter2r> jmalicki: It's quite good, yes. Although it doesn't directly answer my question, it's very interesting! :)
01:06 <jmalicki> peter2r but it helps define things at least :)
01:07 <jmalicki> snadge there is no new information vs. a few months ago
01:07 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm actually a computer scientist, but I'm primarily taking statistics courses now, and I moved towards applied math.
01:08 <jmalicki> peter2r lol i had the same trajectory ;P
01:08 <peter2r> jmalicki: Really? You are a computer scientist? :D
01:08 <jmalicki> snadge yeah, and people get screwed over constantly, best to be on the right side of it
01:08 <jmalicki> peter2r well not an academic
01:09 <jmalicki> snadge same for bernie madoff
01:09 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm only BSc of Computer Science, but still... some background in that area at least :)
01:09 <jmalicki> snadge it does mean bitfinex might be sketchy though, since they're related entities
01:10 <jmalicki> like bitfinex might be a sketchy place to hodl
01:10 <jmalicki> snadge well, you need to get it *out of bitfinex* to be safe
01:12 <jmalicki> snadge name me one crypto exchange that doesn't have some level of sketch you would never accept from a bank
01:13 <jmalicki> snadge coinbase is still probably as dodgy as paypal if not worse ;P
01:13 <jmalicki> and i don't use paypal
01:13 <jmalicki> though they're probably the least dodgy
01:13 <jmalicki> (coinbase, of crypto exchanges)
01:13 <jmalicki> maybe robinhood
01:13 <jmalicki> snadge i don't, i've had more problems with paypal than bank of america and wells fargo combined
01:13 <jmalicki> throw in comcast too
01:14 <jmalicki> snadge if they freeze your account and make you jump through hoops, that's a pain
01:14 <jmalicki> snadge for making payments
01:14 <jmalicki> i got in a situation that had to be resolved with *mail* because my account oddly got flagged
01:15 <jmalicki> snadge i think my account was dormant for a year, so they just froze it.
01:15 <jmalicki> and it took like 3 weeks to undo
01:15 <jmalicki> due to sending stuff first class usps
01:17 <jmalicki> snadge no i mean, a code to unlock my account
01:17 <jmalicki> like i couldn't just resolve it
01:18 <jmalicki> like i can with almost any other financial institution
01:18 <jmalicki> snadge if they actively try to put up roadblocks to getting your money out, that's an issue
01:20 <jmalicki> looool https://twitter.com/MisterCh0c/status/958414152183230464
01:21 <jmalicki> robinhood is good news though, they seem to be very not sketchy
01:21 <jmalicki> snadge then it takes time etc., which sucks if you need to send money now
01:21 <jmalicki> snadge yes, multiple business days to hook to bank account, etc
01:22 <jmalicki> snadge oh if you want to pay the extra fees you can use credit :)
01:22 <jmalicki> snadge 2.9% is small?
01:23 <jmalicki> oh hmm
01:23 <jmalicki> maybe :)
01:23 <jmalicki> i haven't used in years
01:23 <jmalicki> snadge this says 2.9% fees for the sender https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/personal/article/what-are-the-fees-for-paypal-accounts-faq690
01:23 <jmalicki> i guess depends if it counts as a personal payment, like it would with ebay
01:24 <jmalicki> where you send to a person, not a merchant
01:24 <jmalicki> snadge there's no fee if it's linked to a bank account
01:24 <jmalicki> but that's more of a pain
01:25 <jmalicki> snadge yeah... for things where i can use a credit card, i'd rather... just use a credit card
01:25 <jmalicki> snadge lol the fees on bitcoin can be just as bad or worse
01:26 <jmalicki> well, no guarantee you can clear
01:26 <jmalicki> louipc^^
01:26 <jmalicki> snadge https://99bitcoins.com/why-bitcoin-transaction-pending-bitcoin-fees/
01:26 <jmalicki> snadge even $30 fees have taken 5 hours at peak times
01:27 <jmalicki> snadge yeah, other crypto may make sense.. but for transacting bitcoin is horribly broken, it doesn't make sense it's the most popular one
01:27 <jmalicki> louipc money and crypto are fungible
01:28 <jmalicki> louipc i can hold my crypto and spend $100, or i can buy an extra $100 of crypto and spend that
01:28 <jmalicki> louipc it's fungible
01:28 <louipc> jmalicki: yeah but theres fees to go back and forth
01:28 <jmalicki> snadge but bitcoin is the worst of them all
01:29 <jmalicki> snadge it just seems like we should have fled bitcoin for others awhile ago, since it is *the most useless* when it comes to actually using as a currency
01:29 <jmalicki> bitcoin's popularity is threatening the viability of cryptocurrency overall
01:29 <jmalicki> snadge being the flagship, bitcoin is giving cryptocurrency a bad name
01:30 <peter2r> jmalicki: I managed to find the line in the R source code!
01:30 <jmalicki> peter2r!!!! where?
01:30 <jmalicki> what file/line?
01:30 <peter2r> jmalicki: summary.glm
01:30 <jmalicki> peter2r doh, because it's independent!!!
01:31 <jmalicki> peter2r how is that... different?
01:31 <louipc> jmalicki: relax dude. its growing pains
01:31 <jmalicki> peter2r is poisson not doing the same?
01:32 <jmalicki> louipc the paranoid always win
01:32 <jmalicki> (in expectation)
01:32 <peter2r> jmalicki: For Poisson, it is fixed (i.e. 1)
01:32 <jmalicki> peter2r where is the line?
01:33 <jmalicki> oh right sorry
01:34 <peter2r> Try to write summary.glm in the console, jmalicki
01:34 <jmalicki> peter2r i mean how is this different than sum(residuals(modp, type = "pearson")^2) / df.residual(modp) ??
01:35 <jmalicki> for unweighted data?
01:35 <jmalicki> that it's not pearson i guess?
01:35 <jmalicki> peter2r dohh1!!! right ;P
01:35 <jmalicki> peter2r i was looking past that
01:36 <jmalicki> peter2r sorry for not paying closer attention
01:36 <peter2r> jmalicki: No worries :)
01:37 <jmalicki> peter2r and thanks for asking, i learned a lot about overdispersion today!!
01:37 <peter2r> jmalicki: My pleasure!
01:39 <peter2r> jmalicki: https://imgur.com/a/hFHfe
01:40 <jmalicki> https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/master/src/library/stats/R/glm.R#L194
01:41 <peter2r> jmalicki: The R documentation for glm says: "However, care is needed, as extractor functions for class "glm" such as residuals and weights do not just pick out the component of the fit with the same name."
01:42 <jmalicki> peter2r but outside of weights it shouldn't be different?
01:42 <jmalicki> peter2r https://github.com/SurajGupta/r-source/blob/master/src/library/stats/R/glm.R#L831
01:43 <jmalicki> i can't tell how those should be *different*
01:43 <jmalicki> the two lines i linked to
01:44 <jmalicki> peter2r on the face they look the same
01:45 <jmalicki> peter2r but they seem to be mathematically identical?
01:45 <jmalicki> looking at the *code* ?
01:45 <jmalicki> i'm trying to see a difference in the code...
01:45 <peter2r> jmalicki: Hm, probably not... :D
01:46 <jmalicki> clearly there is something subtle
01:46 <jmalicki> peter2r yes i'm also not convinced, but i can't see a line of code where they should differ
01:47 <jmalicki> peter2r it only matters if you have some cases with 0 weights...
01:48 <jmalicki> which unless you do, is irrelevant
01:48 <jmalicki> according to that documentation
01:48 <jmalicki> peter2r i clearly see a difference w/ weights, but that doesn't seem to be what you're doing?
01:51 <jmalicki> peter2r oloooh ok!
01:51 <jmalicki> peter2r they are also not all 1?
01:51 <peter2r> jmalicki: Yes
01:51 <jmalicki> that does seem to be a difference in code.
01:54 <jmalicki> peter2r are you employed?
01:54 <peter2r> jmalicki: No, I'm just a student :)
01:54 <jmalicki> peter2r do you have an internship lined up?
01:55 <peter2r> jmalicki: No, I'm actually trying to get funding for a PhD :)
01:55 <jmalicki> for this summer?
01:56 <peter2r> jmalicki: Probably starting summer/autumn, yes. If I get funding, that is :)
01:56 <jmalicki> peter2r autumn is way later than summer
01:56 <peter2r> jmalicki: Well, usually "summer" is holiday here. The semester is starting from September.
01:57 <jmalicki> peter2r usually summer is where people get an internship for a short time that pays more than their 9 month phd funding.
01:58 <jmalicki> but you could spend it on a beach too
01:59 <peter2r> jmalicki: I already have some interesting project ideas, since I discussed a lot with a PhD student at my university who graduated now. There are some "open ends" in his project.
02:02 <jmalicki> i'll know soon if i have budget, but if you're interesting in reinforcement learning on large datasets or deep learning for text understanding hmu
02:03 <jmalicki> it's hard to find people who actually give a shit and will chase down a discrepency
02:04 <jmalicki> culture opportunity to buy cheap
02:05 <peter2r> jmalicki: Yeah, I guess so. However, I'm mostly interested in statistics. I didn't really work with machine learning, data mining, deep learning, and all these fancy things :D
02:05 <jmalicki> peter2r it is just statistics
02:06 <jmalicki> you can teach tensorflow to someone who knows what an information matrix is, the other way around is... harder
02:06 <jmalicki> causality?
02:07 <peter2r> jmalicki: Not much really. I know the term, but that's about it.
02:07 <jmalicki> it's where things get fun.
02:08 <peter2r> jmalicki: Nice. Are you working as a statistician now?
02:09 <jmalicki> a little bit of office management, a little bit of programming, a little bit of dealing with lawyers, a little bit of dealing with accountants, and statistics where i can
02:09 <jmalicki> i wish it were more :)
02:10 <jmalicki> but i s'pose that's the price of striking it out on your own
02:10 <peter2r> jmalicki: I'm mostly working as a TA these days, so I'm not really employed. Well, then I'm working a few hours per week in the IT development department at the university.
02:10 <jmalicki> peter2r that can't possibly be interesting
02:11 <jmalicki> (the IT part)
02:11 <peter2r> jmalicki: No, not really.
02:16 <peter2r> jmalicki: Do you know if it's possible to see the steps of IWLS algorithm in R, when I use glm?
02:16 <jmalicki> peter2r there's a way you can pass options to glm.control iirc
02:17 <jmalicki> glm.control(trace=TRUE)
02:17 <jmalicki> peter2r just pass trace=TRUE to glm
02:19 <peter2r> jmalicki: I can see the deviance after each iteration then. Do you think I can get more details? :)
02:20 <jmalicki> Peter2r you can always copy the source and edit it
02:20 <peter2r> jmalicki: Yeah, that's a bit dirty, but it works! Thanks :)
02:20 <jmalicki> Is there a way to obtain coefficients for each step of the optimization algorithm in glm function? (https://stackoverflow.com/q/33320973)
02:25 <peter2r> jmalicki: Oh, that's really nice! Thanks!
02:35 <peter2r> Anyway, I'd better get some sleep. It's 3 a.m. here, but thanks a lot for your help, jmalicki. It was a very interesting discussion :)
16:35 <python476> jmalicki: tell us
19:55 <jmalicki_> all men are brutes
19:56 <jmalicki_> ibttis he is biased against women... just because he's also biased against men doesn't change that
19:56 <jmalicki_> also this is ##econometrics ;P
19:56 <woddy> jmalicki_, correct
19:57 <jmalicki_> what are the econometrics of how tarantino treats actresses?
19:57 <python476> jmalicki_: hi there
19:57 <jmalicki_> hi
19:58 <jmalicki_> not as good as yesterday, yesterday was epic
19:58 <jmalicki_> solidfox that's more accounting
19:59 <solidfox> jmalicki_, u kiddin
19:59 <jmalicki_> it's macroeconomic accounting
19:59 <jmalicki_> like what the BEA does
19:59 <solidfox> jmalicki_, hm ok
20:00 <jmalicki_> solidfox what is "the balance of the foreign sector"?
20:00 <woddy> <jmalicki_> solidfox what is "the balance of the foreign sector"?
20:00 <jmalicki_> i think your statement is the first time i've ever heard of "the foreign sector"
20:00 <woddy> jmalicki_++
20:00 <jmalicki_> wat
20:01 <jmalicki_> the balance of trade is just exports - imports....
20:01 <jmalicki_> lol yes  woddy++
20:02 <jmalicki_> solidfox like who uses that? it seems like it must be archaic
20:02 <solidfox> jmalicki_, why does it seem archaic?
20:02 <jmalicki_> solidfox because noone uses it
20:03 <jmalicki_> solidfox actually no, economists don't really use that term these days
20:03 <solidfox> jmalicki_, I've heard some say it, professors I watch on youtube
20:03 <jmalicki_> woddy is correct
20:03 <jmalicki_> solidfox are they also really into von mises?
20:03 <solidfox> jmalicki_, no
20:04 <woddy> jmalicki_, mises never uses that term
20:04 <solidfox> jmalicki_, they're into keynes probably
20:04 <jmalicki_> woddy i just equate him with economists that make no sense
20:04 <woddy> keynes is the conventional way jmalicki_ knows
20:04 <jmalicki_> keynes is also sort of archaic
20:04 <jmalicki_> samuelson, friedman, etc have more defined modern econ
20:05 <jmalicki_> BigRonnieRon and full of contradictoins
20:06 <solidfox> jmalicki_, I'll try to be better at name dropping next time
20:06 <jmalicki_> solidfox lol
20:06 <jmalicki_> solidfox i mean, i'm just unaware of a foreign sector
20:06 <solidfox> jmalicki_, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_balances
20:07 <jmalicki_> solidfox oooh it's an MMT thing. they're also crazy
20:10 <jmalicki_> correct, balance of trade does *not* involve finance
20:11 <jmalicki_> https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf We can use the BEA's definition
20:11 <woddy> <solidfox> jmalicki_, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_balances
20:11 <jmalicki_> that defines US accounting
20:11 <jmalicki_> woddy use the BEA's def
20:12 <jmalicki_> who cares, let's stfu and use the BEA's definition
20:13 <jmalicki_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/zS3v0byz/
20:13 <jmalicki_> The current account measures transactions in goods, services, income, and net unilateral current transfers between U.S. residents and nonresidents that relate to current production and to the incomes generated from productive activities
20:13 <jmalicki_> solidfox woddy^^^
20:14 <jmalicki_> https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2010/02%20February/0210_guide.pdf
20:14 <jmalicki_> BigRonnieRon nice
20:14 <woddy> when jmalicki_  and I hadn't heard of balance of the foreign sector
20:15 <jmalicki_> woddy chill and move on
20:15 <woddy> jmalicki_++
20:16 <jmalicki_> the BEA has a line in NIPA for the foreign sector so it is a thing...
20:16 <jmalicki_> solidfox the last pdf i posted is probably the closest thing to an authoritative reference
20:17 <jmalicki_> but i don't claim to understand it yet
20:17 <jmalicki_> the "A Guide to the U.S. International Transactions Accounts
20:17 <jmalicki_> and the U.S. International Investment Position Accounts "
20:25 <jmalicki_> communism is when there's a small number of private owners who control everything and claim the workers own it while extracting billions for their own life
20:26 <woddy> jmalicki_, the rulers of east
20:26 <jmalicki_> woddy umm mao was not wealthy? wat?
20:26 <woddy> jmalicki_, I'm thinking of east german government people
20:26 <jmalicki_> oh
20:26 <woddy> jmalicki_, only ones I really looked into
20:27 <jmalicki_> woddy the east germans were a puppet of the soviet union, so they didn't really have control
20:27 <woddy> jmalicki_, sovjet also wasn't exteme wealth
20:28 <jmalicki_> woddy Kruschev lived quite a nice lifestyle
20:28 <woddy> jmalicki_, also I doubt sovjets controlled
20:28 <jmalicki_> woddy if you can just take anything you want when you want it, no need to have it be "owned"
20:29 <jmalicki_> what about econometrics?
20:29 <jmalicki_> solidfox was at least asking questions about NIPA which is close :)
20:30 <jmalicki_> bitcoin 5000!
20:31 <solidfox> jmalicki_, I care about economic metrics :)
20:32 <jmalicki_> solidfox cointegration is really cool
20:33 <jmalicki_> woddy i know a genetics professor and dog breeder who says "inbreeding isn't a problem, dumb breeding is"
20:33 <woddy> jmalicki_, I guess he is also sad his chair isn't called "eugenics"
20:34 <jmalicki_> woddy no, she just actually tracks the genes to make sure bad recessive genes don't get inherited
20:34 <woddy> jmalicki_, yeh
20:40 <jmalicki_> woddy trump's immigration policies would have prevented trump
20:40 <jmalicki_> woddy trump is a result of chain migration
21:23 <python476> jmalicki_: have you ever heard of something that sounds like skewed oscillators ?
21:23 <jmalicki_> python476 no but it sounds like it could make sense
21:24 <jmalicki_> python476 hmm it seems to be a EE thing, maybe some EEs applied it to the market
21:24 <python476> jmalicki_: nah, just me trying to retrofit naive fourrier understanding on what I see in graphs
21:33 <jmalicki_> python476 so power spectrum analyses of time series is huge
21:33 <woddy> <jmalicki_> python476 so power spectrum analyses of time series is huge"
21:33 <jmalicki_> ?
21:34 <python476> never heard of this jmalicki_  :)
21:34 <jmalicki_> python476 if you've heard of like seasonally-adjusted unemployment, etc it's how they do it
21:34 <jmalicki_> woddy no i mean is huge like, it's a fundamental building block everyone uses
21:35 <jmalicki_> something that is new and trendy is not huge
21:35 <woddy> jmalicki_, ok.. I thought you meant huge in the slang way
21:35 <jmalicki_> python476 example https://anomaly.io/detect-seasonality-using-fourier-transform-r/
21:36 <jmalicki_> python476 or https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/sa-elearning/spectral-analysis
21:37 <jmalicki_> as2333 umm hayek very deliberately split off
21:37 <woddy> jmalicki_, precisely
21:40 <jmalicki_> as2333 i mean they had disagreements, but coexisted for awhile, then hayek was like fuck all y'all
21:40 <woddy> jmalicki_, yes yes
21:41 <jmalicki_> python476 you figure seasonality out?
21:41 <python476> jmalicki_: nope, not yet, it's spacex time bro
21:41 <jmalicki_> dorei losing money
21:42 <jmalicki_> dorei support/resistance?
21:43 <dorei> jmalicki_: no, it just shows the range each day sort of, cant remember the name :(
21:43 <jmalicki_> GDI i have a new account i'm trying to get pattern day trader status in and don't have it yet
21:44 <jmalicki_> like i made 4 trades!!
21:45 <marginal_> getting active trader status by the IRS jmalicki_?
21:45 <jmalicki_> morginal_ no pattern day trader status http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules you get 4x margin
21:46 <jmalicki_> marginal_ i have a call with greentradertax next week about incorporation and active trader status
21:46 <jmalicki_> marginal_ portfolio margin is better but less predictable
21:46 <jmalicki_> it can be more arbitrary
21:50 <jmalicki_> woddy like game theory and linear programming and machine learning are offshoots of US wwii efforts, so...
21:50 <woddy> jmalicki_, errm...
21:50 <jmalicki_> woddy yes much, but the roots were in the manhattan project and wwii logistics
21:51 <jmalicki_> woddy bayesian machine learning was mostly developed in the manhattan project, for instance
21:52 <jmalicki_> woddy but i mean moddern MCMC bayesian machine learning
21:52 <jmalicki_> woddy e.g. Stanislav Ulam etc
21:53 <woddy> jmalicki_, the transport equation related neutronics problems were solved trough monte carlo..
21:55 <jmalicki_> woddy no it's not, it's very relevant to econometrics
21:55 <woddy> jmalicki_, relevant yes
23:11 <jmalicki_> bitcoin 1000!!!!
23:11 <jmalicki_> cryptotrash today was pretty calm
23:12 <jmalicki_> cryptotrash probably just a reset of ridiculousness
23:12 <jmalicki_> but some people probably lost their shirts
23:12 <jmalicki_> cryptotrash this is probably like the giant stock market crash of august 2007
23:12 <jmalicki_> no...
23:15 <jmalicki_> lol no
23:16 <jmalicki_> cryptotrash sounds like nouriel roubini
23:16 <jmalicki_> that's the sort of thing he's been doing
23:16 <jmalicki_> or nassim taleb
23:17 <jmalicki_> cryptotrash oh shit they used a spread
23:18 <jmalicki_> zamanf chart them and draw lines
23:19 <zamanf> jmalicki_, I want to get numbers from calculations
23:24 <jmalicki_> python476 econometrics of financial markets
23:26 <python476> jmalicki_: campbell ?
23:27 <jmalicki_> andrew lo.. and maybe campbell?
23:28 <jmalicki_> this month has been the best since like fall 2008
23:29 <jmalicki_> that's what it seems like
23:37 <jmalicki_> marginal_ you should look at order books
23:38 <marginal_> you should suck my nuts jmalicki_
23:38 <jmalicki_> marginal_ sounds fun
23:43 <jmalicki_> marijnfs http://www.cboe.com/products/vix-index-volatility/vix-options-and-futures/vix-index/the-vix-index-calculation
23:45 <jmalicki_> marijnfs the tldr is it uses the black-scholes option pricing model to back out implied volatility, averaged across the next two months using a time-weighted index, across a number of different strikes
23:45 <jmalicki_> it's supposed to model the standard deviation of prices 30 days out
23:46 <jmalicki_> marginal_ noone can use bitcoin for payments, it sucks too bad
23:47 <jmalicki_> FRWB because libertarians are dumb
20:53 <jmalicki_> grill the polymath project, terry tao's thing?
20:54 jmalicki_ is now known as jmalicki
22:37 <jmalicki> python476 correct, life is just a big Markov Decision Problem you need to apply Bellman's equation to solve
22:38 <python476> jmalicki: tell me you wrote a coin bot and you're eager to discuss ideas about the topic
22:39 <jmalicki> python476 if you can write a bot with an api that pushes quotes, and executes trades when they happen, i'll fill in the logic part and split the profits
22:39 <jmalicki> oh and also get me a few months of historical tick data (or at least minute bars)
22:41 <jmalicki> the strat part is easy, the infra of the bot is the fucking pain in the ass
22:43 <jmalicki> it can be many things
22:56 <jmalicki> because finland is sensible?
01:48 <jmalicki> bitcoin traders aren't yet good enough for there to be a benefit from watching the order book anyway imo
01:48 <FRWB> jmalicki, that doesn't make sense
01:48 <jmalicki> like, only if you're moderately good about thinking about things and trying to conceal size etc. is there information in the order book
01:49 <jmalicki> FRWB if traders always just make giant market orders, there isn't much information in the order book
01:50 <jmalicki> FRWB there is more market impact you can observe in bitcion than in equities with a fraction of the volume and market cap
01:51 <jmalicki> like, really really dumb market making strategies still work on bitcoin
01:51 <FRWB> jmalicki, right, because the barrier for entry is low, there are people buying tops and selling bottoms continuously
01:51 <jmalicki> FRWB only once that gets arbed out does the order book begin to become useful
01:52 <FRWB> jmalicki, again that doesn't make sense. a shark feeds on fish. why would the shark want those fish gone?
01:53 <jmalicki> FRWB it's not unhappiness, just don't bother looking at the order book when there are way lower hanging fruit
01:53 <jmalicki> when there's a giant slow easy to catch fish in front of your face, stop trying to chase the tiny fast fish that are far away
01:53 <jmalicki> there is barely an intermediate market at all at this point
02:15 <python476> rekt jmalicki you mostly trade on non crypto markets ?
02:16 <jmalicki> Yes
02:17 <jmalicki> if i did it professionally, my fees would go up. so as a side channel of course
02:18 <jmalicki> nope
01:36 <jmalicki> barrenwuffet with margin trading you want each trade to be a tiny proportion of your bankroll
01:38 <jmalicki> latentprion it's what professionals call "a crash"
01:38 <jmalicki> better when it was down 666
01:38 <jmalicki> oh?
01:40 <jmalicki> looks a lot like the beginning of september 2008
01:40 <jmalicki> these things don't happen overnite
01:41 <jmalicki> latentprion it's totally rational, as interest rates go up, discounted future cash flows are worth less in present dollars
01:42 <jmalicki> latentprion that's the past, what matters is the future
01:42 <jmalicki> latentprion that's why the market *has been* going up
01:43 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, as even in january the market has been going up
01:43 <jmalicki> the fed has been strongly signaling imminent increases
01:43 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, and teh stockmarket has repeatedly gone up
01:43 <jmalicki> until now, when they're about to raise them
01:43 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, and you can see the market go up in conjunction
01:43 <latentprion> jmalicki: nothing you're saying makes sense
01:43 <jmalicki> latentprion the market reacts on the future, not the past
01:44 <jmalicki> no
01:44 <jmalicki> "as interest rates go up, discounted future cash flows are worth less in present dollars"
01:45 <jmalicki> there's multiple things going on
01:45 <jmalicki> some is the underlying health of the economy and profits
01:45 <jmalicki> which can increase
01:45 <jmalicki> which pushes things up
01:45 <jmalicki> latentprion raising the funds rate raises the interest rate
01:46 <jmalicki> it *is* an interest rate
01:46 <jmalicki> there's some amount of overbought too
01:46 <jmalicki> it's never one factor
01:46 <jmalicki> a bunch of stuff pushing in different directions
01:47 <jmalicki> but raising rates is an important fundamental factor
01:47 <jmalicki> latentprion ok, say rates go from ~2% to ~5%
01:47 <latentprion> jmalicki: Yes I agree with you
01:48 <jmalicki> latentprion that would justify a ~15% drop in stock prices
01:48 <jmalicki> like, if expectations of future rates change from 2% to 5%
01:49 <jmalicki> latentprion well, stock prices have gone up pretty dramatically over the past year on that expectation
01:49 <jmalicki> latentprion but the interest rate increase expectation is new
01:49 <jmalicki> any growth/tax cuts was *already baked into* stock prices
01:50 <latentprion> jmalicki: She said she plans to raise it 4 times this year
01:50 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, and as you said, "But I don't think that the funds rate increase is as powerful as the tax cuts and the current trajectory of the US economy toward 5% growth" so that was winning
01:50 <latentprion> jmalicki: what, in your estimation, overtook the tax cuts?
01:51 <jmalicki> latentprion no i mean the stock prices have gone up over 1yr because the expectations of future growth/tax cuts were a bigger deal than raising rates
01:51 <jmalicki> but now expectations for future rates are going up yet more
01:51 <jmalicki> but there's no expectation for additional growth beyond what was already projected from tax cuts
01:52 <jmalicki> like the stock market doesn't go up *when* the economy is strong
01:52 <jmalicki> it goes up when you *expect* the economy to get stronger
01:52 <jmalicki> so that's already accounetd for
01:52 <jmalicki> further rate increases are relatively new news
01:52 <jmalicki> FRWB++
01:54 <jmalicki> and we're not high enough to understand it yet
01:54  * FRWB passes blunt to jmalicki 
01:55 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, and it means stock prices would *go down* during that boom
01:55 <latentprion> jmalicki: I don't agree with that, but let me tackle FRWB first please
01:55 <jmalicki> ultimately, i have a choice to invest in the stock market vs. bonds
01:56 <jmalicki> if interest rates double, bonds start to look a lot more attractive by comparison
01:56 <jmalicki> latentprion everything is both a cause and effect
01:56 <latentprion> jmalicki: Could uyou please let me address FRWB
01:56 <jmalicki> latentprion they both change discounting of future cash flows in the same way
01:57 <jmalicki> one *Also* changes expectation of cash flows
01:57 <jmalicki> they both matter
01:57 <jmalicki> latentprion that's not how fed rate raises work
01:57 <jmalicki> it's change in rates, not reserve requirements
01:57 <jmalicki> yes ,which is a *rate*
01:58 <jmalicki> no
01:58 <jmalicki> it is caused by selling and buying bonds
01:58 <jmalicki> the reserve ratio does not change
01:58 <jmalicki> latentprion yes, but they can buy and sell bonds until they do so
01:59 <jmalicki> there is no modification of reserve requirements that is part of that
01:59 <jmalicki> it can do that separately, of course
01:59 <jmalicki> but it is not part of fomo
01:59 <jmalicki> that is not connected
02:00 <jmalicki> surely if that is true you can find some fed documentation on it
02:01 <jmalicki> latentprion the fed's own documents show it has not changed the reserve requirements since 2012 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm
02:01 <jmalicki> latentprion you watched a really bad youtube video
02:02 <jmalicki> yes
02:03 <jmalicki> no
02:03 <jmalicki> the OMO is far more active and far larger
02:04 <jmalicki> lol
02:07 <jmalicki> FRWB latentprion wants higher rates to cause higher stock and bond prices
02:08 <jmalicki> at least if it's the fed that raises them
02:09 <jmalicki> latentprion you can borrow $1000 from me at 10% interest to have $1001 dollars in a year, sound like a good deal?
02:09 <jmalicki> it's a really high rate, so the $1001 is worth more today
02:17 <jmalicki> odyss3us cool
02:21 <jmalicki> latentprion so you want the fed to print lots of money?
02:21 <latentprion> jmalicki: I said I want the fed funds rate LEFT ALONE
02:21 <jmalicki> since that's what leaving the rate alone as the economy gets hot means
02:22 <jmalicki> latentprion in a hot economy, leaving the rate alone means printning more money
02:22 <jmalicki> latentprion keeping money stable means changing rates to match the market
02:22 <latentprion> jmalicki: Did you hear what you just said?
02:22 <Odyss3us> thanks FRWB, jmalicki
02:23 <jmalicki> latentprion when people want to borrow money to invest because the economy is good, that pushes interest rates up
02:23 <jmalicki> latentprion in the market
02:23 <jmalicki> the only way for the fed to *maintain* the current rates is to increase money printing
02:23 <jmalicki> since it's fighting against the natural desire of the market to increase rates
02:24 <jmalicki> a stable interest rate and stable amounts of money are not the same
02:25 <jmalicki> MV=PY and all
02:32 <FRWB> jmalicki, whats your profession if you don't mind me asking? trader?
02:32 <jmalicki> software engineer starting a trading firm
02:34 <abomb> jmalicki, I am :) https://www.cpaytoday.com/ :)
02:35 <jmalicki> you are?
02:36 <jmalicki> don't have a site, have no need for one
02:36 <jmalicki> until maybe i want to recruit or something
02:36 <jmalicki> abomb yes
02:36 <abomb> jmalicki, link?
02:36 <jmalicki> i don't want people to know i exist
02:36 <jmalicki> abomb it's private
02:37 <jmalicki> no, you can't have it
02:37 <jmalicki> i have an app that prints money, why would i share it?
02:38 <jmalicki> it has limited capacity to print money, so anything i share goes to someone else instead of me
02:38 <jmalicki> i have
02:39 <jmalicki> and its' been a shitshow this week
02:39 <jmalicki> correct
02:39 <jmalicki> i don't jhave users
02:39 <jmalicki> there is me
02:39 <jmalicki> yes
02:39 <jmalicki> there is no incentive to have users
02:39 <FRWB> based on the east or west jmalicki ?
02:39 <jmalicki> west
02:40 <jmalicki> which sucks
02:40 <jmalicki> i am not a morning person
02:40 <jmalicki> fixing bugs in production and plugging holes at 6:30am blows
02:41 <jmalicki> yes
02:41 <jmalicki> frwb hopefully i can make it stop sucking soon :)
02:41 <jmalicki> i like the space
02:41 <jmalicki> i have a wework
02:41 <jmalicki> kombucha and cold brew on top
02:42 <jmalicki> and someone else makes the internet etc go
02:42 <jmalicki> shit, i probably use enough power and drink enough kombucha for the lease to be free ;P
02:44 <jmalicki> market hours to hold together the duct tape, and later hours to fix things for real
02:44 <jmalicki> thx
02:44 <jmalicki> if these awesome market conditions keep up maybe i can hire people to hold the duct tape ;P
02:45 <jmalicki> FRWB i'm not convinced i have enough capacity to be worthwhile
02:45 <jmalicki> like within a few weeks i might have all the capital from compounding i can make use of
02:46 <jmalicki> but then who knows if i can extend/improve to something more
02:46 <jmalicki> abomb yeah
02:47 <jmalicki> legacy
02:48 <jmalicki> could expand into crypto but this is already working and keeping me busy
02:48 <jmalicki> if it gets automated/stable enuogh i don't have to touch it and watch it like a hawk i can look into things like that
02:48 <jmalicki> kaner the price will change a lot
02:53 <jmalicki> FRWB unless you trade on them
02:54 <jmalicki> most real book pressure is driven by automated trading
02:54 <jmalicki> which is present in crypto, but still nascent
02:55 <jmalicki> python476 there is usually lots of "hidden book"
02:55 <jmalicki> which can be a challenge
02:55 <jmalicki> python476 if you can look at the book to estimate the "hidden book" that can be really useful
02:55 <jmalicki> python476 like people are often ready to update the book as it changes
02:56 <jmalicki> which is sort of like a standing order
02:56 <jmalicki> but hidden until entered
02:56 <jmalicki> also, save it to disk
02:56 <jmalicki> and examine it later
02:57 <jmalicki> FRWB yes...
02:57 <jmalicki> you can rarely look at historical
02:57 <jmalicki> it's helpful to reexamine the past as you get new ideas
02:57 <FRWB> jmalicki, i had the idea of doing that and training an ML algo on it, but i felt like it'd be a crazy amount of space
02:58 <jmalicki> FRWB not really that bad.... the options order book is something else though, because you have all of the strikes x all of the maturities
02:59 <jmalicki> FRWB it's really not that bad
03:00 <jmalicki> FRWB so like for equities, most of those orders don't even exist on SIP
03:00 <jmalicki> like the flash orders etc
03:00 <jmalicki> but SIP is quite reasonable at least
03:00 <FRWB> jmalicki, you don't pay for the other data feed do you? forget the name
03:01 <jmalicki> there are tons of data feeds
03:02 <jmalicki> FRWB oh yeah
03:02 <FRWB> you don't lease a direct feed do you jmalicki ?
03:02 <jmalicki> FRWB but no point in worrying about data changing faster than you can react
03:03 <jmalicki> FRWB not at the moment
03:03 <jmalicki> no time to do any more software integration
03:03 <jmalicki> FRWB $20k/mo is my understanding
03:03 <jmalicki> yes
03:04 <jmalicki> for nyse at least
03:04 <jmalicki> some others are cheaper
03:04 <jmalicki> i think a lot of the others are more in the like $1k/mo
03:05 <jmalicki> NYSE was just like fuck you we're gonna monetize this
03:05 <jmalicki> the raise to $20k is very recent
03:05 <jmalicki> NYSE realized they could get away with it
03:06 <jmalicki> FRWB bloomberg has been fighting w/ regulators over it pretty hard
03:06 <jmalicki> since they have to pass it down to their users
03:06 <jmalicki> http://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-letter-targets-nyse-trading-fee-changes-2017-4
03:06 <jmalicki> it's a monopoly charging monopoly rents
03:06 <jmalicki> or oligopoly firm at least
03:07 <jmalicki> i mean, of all the things to charge for, charging hft firms to see all the flash orders seems like a reasonable thing
03:10 <jmalicki> lol
03:11 <jmalicki> FRWB for now i am working w/ relatively high latency
03:11 <jmalicki> since it's easier to do
03:12 <jmalicki> once those profits get taken, the question is can i find more at higher latency to justify building etc
03:12 <jmalicki> one of many possible directions for growth
03:16 <jmalicki> 17 years professional
03:16 <jmalicki> 7 of it doing web-scale machine learning systems that act in real-time
03:16 <jmalicki> moderately smaller players
03:17 <jmalicki> wee!
03:49 <python476> jmalicki: what languages ?
03:51 <jmalicki> Scala python c++ SQL java
20:44 <jmalicki> BigRonnieRon going all in on anything is generally a bad idea...
20:44 <jmalicki> so did Nassim Taleb put his money where his mouth is and make a trillion?
20:44 <jmalicki> lol
20:46 <jmalicki> intx vegas has better odds
20:46 <jmalicki> intx the house advantage is bigger with startups
20:46 <jmalicki> cryptotrash if they let you invest they could be shut down by the SEC
20:47 <jmalicki> cryptotrash Reg D
20:47 <jmalicki> cryptotrash $200k/yr income or[... $1m in assets i think
20:47 <jmalicki> cryptotrash either they need to require that of all investors, or IPO
20:47 <jmalicki> IPO is the alternative to avoid those restrictions
20:48 <jmalicki> cryptotrash https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor
20:48 <jmalicki> cryptotrash given that they are exposing themselves to charges of securities fraud that could cause your investment to be worthless even if the company is otherwise doing well, even better reason to not invest in that sartup :)
20:49 <jmalicki> cryptotrash that's why Facebook had to IPO when they did. they accidentally got some non-accredited investors
20:50 <jmalicki> and were forced by the SEC
20:50 <jmalicki> it's no joke
20:50 <jmalicki> like "you broke the rules IPO or go to jail"
20:50 <jmalicki> cryptotrash probably illegal
20:51 <jmalicki> cryptotrash oh wait no... the JOBS act allows some of it now
20:51 <jmalicki> i forgot about that rules change... but it's like only 5 years old or something ;P
20:51 <jmalicki> sorry
20:51 <jmalicki> i don't know what the new rules are exactly
20:52 <jmalicki> https://www.cooleygo.com/can-you-raise-money-from-unaccredited-investors/
20:52 <jmalicki> cryptotrash huh, even kickstarter was technically illegal until they changed the rules
20:53 <jmalicki> BigRonnieRon that link mentions the recent rule change
20:53 <jmalicki> https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/rccomplianceguide-051316.htm
20:53 <BigRonnieRon> jmalicki: Ah ok interesting
20:54 <jmalicki> i guess the SEC was like, huh, this seems useful and legit and we didn't really mean for *this* to be illegal
20:55 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they've basically said they're going to prosecute all of them that don't ffollow the full ipo process, it will just take awhile to get around to it
20:55 <jmalicki> they're spinning up teams of people
20:55 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they can still go after you three years later
20:56 <jmalicki> cryptotrash probably even longer...
20:56 <jmalicki> cryptotrash 2 for discovery 5 for prosecution http://www.securitieslaw.com/information/eligibility-statutes-of-limitation.asp
20:56 <jmalicki> ah
20:57 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they claim some jurisdiction and have extradition treaties if you market to americans too
20:57 <jmalicki> so you'd have to exclude americans
20:57 <jmalicki> (which many icos smartly do)
20:58 <jmalicki> cryptotrash you just need to make sure no part of it touches american soil
20:58 <jmalicki> likje you use computers on AWS, they might claim jurisdiction
20:58 <jmalicki> it's kinda crazy the shit they pull with that
20:59 <jmalicki> yeah it depends how they see it
20:59 <jmalicki> if you want to do an ICO you should talk to a lawyer who knows about this stuff
20:59 <jmalicki> to make sure you don't run afoul
21:02 <jmalicki> https://twitter.com/BCAppelbaum/status/960614104552689665
21:04 <jmalicki> ossifrage a lot of the ICOs were obviously illegal on their face, the question is whether tether is what they claim
21:04 <jmalicki> so they might take longer to get evidence whatever
21:05 <jmalicki> well you have to subpoena the evidence and then get it
21:05 <jmalicki> it's not public information
21:05 <ossifrage> jmalicki, are there any ICOs that where even remotely sane/non-scams?
21:06 <jmalicki> ossifrage many were sane but still illegal
21:06 <jmalicki> or arguably sane
21:06 <jmalicki> the sec was clear you have to follow all the rules of an IPO to do an ICO in the US
21:06 <jmalicki> you can do coins, fine, but all the rules still apply
21:09 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I'm not worried about them being illegal, I more interested if any where actually doing something real with the funds raised
21:09 <jmalicki> ossifrage dunno
21:09 <jmalicki> ossifrage i mean, ethereum was an ico
21:12 <jmalicki> the CFTC probably felt obligated to subpoena with all of the talk
21:12 <jmalicki> like if it was a fraud and they didn't do at least a cursory examination they would look bad
21:12 <jmalicki> especially post-Bernie Madoff
21:16 <jmalicki> just because it's someone with a bitter axe to grind doesn't make it false
21:17 <jmalicki> almost all accusations of shady shit are made by an informant who wants to screw someone over
21:17 <jmalicki> ossifrage maybe he's behind a crappier exchange?
21:17 <jmalicki> and just wants to eliminate competition and scare people away?
21:21 <jmalicki> ossifrage maybe he's short tether
21:21 <ossifrage> jmalicki, if tether goes poof I'm not sure how you would collect on that short
21:21 <jmalicki> doing a dump and pump
21:22 <jmalicki> ossifrage it means you just don't owe the tether back you borrowed
21:22 <jmalicki> ossifrage the way a short works is you borrow tether, collect dollars when you sell, then later have to buy
21:22 <jmalicki> if bitfinex goes poof, do you need to give tether back?
21:22 <ossifrage> jmalicki, if tether implodes it will take everything else with it
21:23 <jmalicki> ossifrage yeah, but tether would go down 100%, say btc may only go down 80%
21:39 <jmalicki> python476 you want to short CO2 since there will be so much of it in the future it will be cheaper
21:40 <jmalicki> i'm investing in ice
21:40 <BigRonnieRon> jmalicki: Jim Rogers approves. Commodities ftw
23:22 jmalicki (sid101323@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-pmlzolmkdaiqfirw) has quit ()
23:23 jmalicki (sid101323@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-tyecjqksgxdzcqim) has joined ##econometrics
11:13 <moriarty> jmalicki, weird how?
11:14 <jmalicki> moriarty the hurdle rate for real investments becomes very high
11:14 <moriarty> jmalicki, risk appetite for individuals tend to be across the spectrum too once you've fulfilled all your base needs
11:15 <jmalicki> moriarty perhaps it could mean that medicore projects like remodeling of kitchens go away, and we start worrying about relocting to mars instead
11:15 <jmalicki> moriarty sure there's some of that on a micro scale
11:16 <jmalicki> but economics will incent people to actually be efficient
11:16 <moriarty> jmalicki, sure, also you don't want to lose all your monies, so you'd sacrifice some efficiency for protection through diversification
11:17 <jmalicki> moriarty++ true
11:17 <jmalicki> just like today i always have a reasonable amount in a checking account
11:17 <jmalicki> but that is also usually a small fraction of wealth
11:18 <jmalicki> yep
11:18 <jmalicki> if you're in the US it's also very illegal which makes it akward
11:18 <moriarty> jmalicki, i think you've got a great point though
11:19 <jmalicki> like the other countries would have to turn against the US for it to be protected
11:19 <jmalicki> moriarty well at some point everything else goes to shit and ocassionally you can repair your slum for 20% ;P
11:19 <jmalicki> but until it gets there noone would bother
11:20 <jmalicki> but it has implications like landlords would be incented to act more like slumlords across the board
11:21 <jmalicki> except for very high end properties
11:21 <jmalicki> moriarty but if bitcoin gets big, then everyone is in it
11:21 <jmalicki> like truly big
11:21 <jmalicki> like, within this cycle i think bitcoin either escapes to the real world or the bubble falls apart
11:22 <jmalicki> like critical mass is starting
11:22 <moriarty> jmalicki, that's a great observation
11:23 <jmalicki> and if it makes it out we need to think of longer-term what does the future look like
11:23 <jmalicki> moriarty but the infrastructure is rolling
11:25 <jmalicki> TXDillo at some point it starts to be correlated, since at some point it's big enough to be part of the market portfolio, and demographics of people's saving and dissaving drive the price
11:25 <jmalicki> we're prolly not there yet
11:25 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they're primary concerned with banking, not equities
11:26 <jmalicki> cryptotrash since the banking system is a fundamental part of how fiat money works
11:26 <jmalicki> equities and bitcoin aren't so much
11:27 <jmalicki> cryptotrash in 2008 short-term debt markets were a primary driver of the crash
11:27 <jmalicki> well the mechanics at least
11:28 <jmalicki> TXDillo thanks to the blockchain, they can track exactly who has it
11:28 <jmalicki> TXDillo the blockchain is a gift to the NSA ;P
11:28 <jmalicki> yeah, it's all an arms race
11:28 <jmalicki> but then taproot can become illegal
11:31 <jmalicki> the IRS generally solves taxes through double-entry bookkeeping
11:31 <jmalicki> what if the IRS required you to report on it to get rid of the privacy?
11:31 <moriarty> jmalicki, yeah that's a great point, i think so far the bills are pretty moderate when it comes to what stays private and what doesn't
11:32 <jmalicki> i imagine that would make the US treasury very twitchy
11:32 <jmalicki> no, dark pools require reporting *after the fact*
11:33 <jmalicki> FINRA does regulate them and require reporting of trades
11:33 <ThriftyDillo> jmalicki> i imagine that would make the US treasury very twitchy << certainly the Federal Reserve
11:33 <jmalicki> and dark pool trades go on the consolidated tape
11:33 <jmalicki> with a delay
11:34 <jmalicki> http://www.finra.org/investors/unraveling-mystery-over-counter-trading
11:35 <jmalicki> i don't expect the treasury to allow anything that obscures their view
11:35 <jmalicki> if bitcoin gets a magical privacy feature, everyone might be suspect
11:35 <jmalicki> and kyc could become way more intrusive
11:36 <jmalicki> sure
11:36 <jmalicki> but nothing will be allowed to exist below the light at any scale
11:37 <jmalicki> if taproot successfully provides privacy, it will likely mean holding bitcoin becomes illegal
11:37 <jmalicki> well privacy from the irs
11:38 <jmalicki> today fiat currency provides privacy, and regulators are making it illegal across the world and cracking down
11:40 <jmalicki> moriarty the irs has deep interest in knowing both sides of every contract, to ensure that everyone complies
11:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, sure, so that's where oversight data comes in
11:41 <jmalicki> ya
11:41 <jmalicki> but they won't allow a solution that keeps FDR from confiscating it
11:41 <jmalicki> i mean one might exist, but regulators will likely view anything that touches it with suspicion
11:42 <jmalicki> just as today withdrawing large amounts of cash is criminal regardless of how innocent your intentions
11:43 <jmalicki> yes, it is
11:43 <jmalicki> ThriftyDillo structuring is itself a crime
11:43 <jmalicki> https://www.money-education.com/resources/financial-planning-news-and-blogs/blog/129-structuring-cash-transactions-under-10-000-is-criminal
11:43 <ThriftyDillo> jmalicki> ThriftyDillo structuring is itself a crime << that's evading, which is a crime
11:43 <jmalicki> arij they're worried it might allow your counterparty to avoid paying taxes
11:44 <jmalicki> ThriftyDillo yes, and if you withdraw >$10k, you have to tell them where you're spending it and who's getting the money
11:44 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: no you dont.
11:44 <arij> jmalicki: i dont care what my counterparty does
11:45 <ThriftyDillo> jmalicki> ThriftyDillo yes, and if you withdraw >$10k, you have to tell them where you're spending it and who's getting the money << yes, thanks Drug War
11:46 <cryptotrash> how old is that jmalicki that law
11:46 <jmalicki> 1970
11:47 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3 i mean you may have a defense still, but they will not look kindly
11:47 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: the fbi had to defend themselves, actually
11:47 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3 yeah, and it still happens all the time
11:48 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3 they can, and you have to prove your money is innocent of a crime
11:48 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: not anymore.
11:48 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3 what case?
11:48 <jmalicki> moriarty well i mean, he didn't quite get away
11:48 <jmalicki> moriarty it certainly hurt him
11:48 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: dunno, it was a few years ago
11:50 <jmalicki> moriarty that's how they caught him with his prostitute
11:50 <jmalicki> that made him resign
11:50 <jmalicki> the fbi investigated what he was spending it on...
11:50 <jmalicki> and wiretapped his phone
11:51 <moriarty> jmalicki, i thought it ironic that Spitzer was caught under his own law
11:51 <jmalicki> lol
11:53 <jmalicki> it's also related to the 500euro disappearing and india getting rid of cash
11:54 <jmalicki> now that credit cards are sufficiently ubiquitous, the world is trying to make cash increasingly illegal
11:55 <jmalicki> Shigufurido in practice it's basically cashless anyway
11:55 <jmalicki> oh that's what you said
11:56 <jmalicki> interesting...
11:56 <jmalicki> ThriftDillo oh but that's sort of the same thing - it gives control to the state
11:56 <jmalicki> you don't give someone actual metal, you tell the state who you're transacting with and to update books
11:57 <jmalicki> so in some sense it is the same sort of state control
11:57 <jmalicki> ThriftyDillo++ interesting
11:57 <jmalicki> ThriftyDillo it makes it way easier for FDR, one stop shopping
11:59 <jmalicki> privacy is becoming very impossible
11:59 <jmalicki> at least it's an arm's race
12:00 <jmalicki> today, if you have any privacy, you must have something to hide
12:00 <jmalicki> so you're investigated
12:00 <jmalicki> lol
12:01 <jmalicki> or at least an Alexa
12:01 <jmalicki> i imagine the NSA would freak out
12:02 <jmalicki> i mean today, the Navy Seals post their GPS coordinates to strava when they're on mission
12:02 <jmalicki> we should expect nothing less from the President
12:02 <jmalicki> cryptotrash http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5325341/Military-intelligence-staff-exposed-GPS-jogging-app.html
12:03 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they're sharing their jogs through secret bases in Syria via social media
12:04 <jmalicki> yeah i know
12:04 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3 they're getting rid of the privacy they're not supposed to hav
12:04 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: not quite
12:05 <jmalicki> they just need to replace it with a special SIPRNet social media jogging tracker
12:05 <jmalicki> hmm i should write a proposal for funding
12:06 <jmalicki> "to avoid national security leaks, SIPRNet needs a jogging tracker"
12:15 <Diablo-D3> [06:06:20] <jmalicki> "to avoid national security leaks, SIPRNet needs a jogging tracker"
12:15 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: honestly Im surprised they dont have one
12:15 <jmalicki> maybe they do
12:16 <jmalicki> ya
12:16 <jmalicki> they probably have their own version of facebook
12:16 <jmalicki> and snapchat
12:16 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: actually, they kinda do
12:17 <jmalicki> ah
12:17 <jmalicki> so you can post cat videos taken behind enemy lines?
12:17 <jmalicki> lol
12:17 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3++
12:17 <ThriftyDillo>  <jmalicki> so you can post cat videos taken behind enemy lines? << lol
21:46 <python476> I asked jmalicki about skewed oscillators, and that's what I had in mind at the time
21:47 <jmalicki> Wavelets are hot because they can handle jumps well
21:47 <jmalicki> Fourier series not so much
21:48 <python476> jmalicki: jumps as in sudden drops ?
21:49 <jmalicki> Or gains
21:49 <jmalicki> Like on news etc prices often move quite a but in a short time
21:50 <jmalicki> Or there are more complicated jump diffusion models
21:50 <jmalicki> That are like there's some probability you may change your waves at any moment
21:58 <jmalicki> Or regime change models
21:59 <jmalicki> python476: one of the problems is prices often diverge from continuous a lot
21:59 <jmalicki> But continuous models are still useful, but there are major departures
22:10 <jmalicki> python476: but then you get Gibbs' phenomenon
23:34 <jmalicki> plaerzen i bet there's some sort of artisanal pot that does well in our climate
23:35 <jmalicki> plaerzen like if you want a warm climate, why so much in BC and Mendocino county?
23:49 <plaerzen> jmalicki: they just have optimal growing climates for the market they serve - in mendocino's case, I think remoteness has to do with it.
23:50 <jmalicki> plaerzen it may depend on what you're trying to achieve... like with wine many different growing conditions produce different grapes well
23:53 <jmalicki> plaerzen yeah, just that so much is grown in cold wet climates that there might be something to it
23:58 <jmalicki> python476 eat the marshmallow later
00:03 <jmalicki> Odyss3us is DoD allowed to be on Azure these days?
00:03  * jmalicki doesn't follow that stuff closely
00:03 <jmalicki> i thought they had an exclusive aws contract for govcloud or something
00:04 <jmalicki> oh huh answered it myself, i guess they do, cool!
00:04 <jmalicki> i mean azure has a govcloud
00:04 <Odyss3us> jmalicki: there is Mil Azure yes
00:05 <jmalicki> cool
00:05 <jmalicki> is there a SIPRNet or JWICS azure yet?
00:05 <jmalicki> or is that classified?
00:06 <jmalicki> an azure deployment that the microsoft CEO isn't allowed to know exists
00:06 <jmalicki> ooh
00:07 <blablaa> jmalicki, long time!
00:07 <blablaa> jmalicki, i've just launched by btc/usd trading bot!
00:07 <jmalicki> nice!!!
00:07 <jmalicki> blablaa is it working?
00:07 <blablaa> jmalicki, it's an HFT bot operating in a negative fees environment
00:07 <blablaa> jmalicki, rock solid :D
00:08 <blablaa> jmalicki, it gets paid for each order executed
00:08 <jmalicki> nice
00:08 <blablaa> jmalicki, last time we chatted you were working on NPL!
00:08 <jmalicki> npl?
00:09 <jmalicki> didn't i chat with you in the last few mos?
00:09 <jmalicki> i'm dealing with operational issues with my bot now
00:09 <jmalicki> and making it a bit more robust to dark pools that delay reporting, to make it more reliable
00:10 <blablaa> jmalicki, what is it trading?!
00:10 <jmalicki> blablaa US equities
00:10 <jmalicki> it was basically designed for the past week
00:11 <jmalicki> sadly it's too janky to do as well as it should be :)
00:11 <jmalicki> the cost of being lazy i guess
00:12 <jmalicki> it's designed to sort of front-run VWAP and similar automated trading algorithms
00:12 <jmalicki> legally front run by detecting their footprint on public market signals
00:13 <blablaa> jmalicki, :)
00:15 <jmalicki> i shouldjust go deep on btc
00:15 <jmalicki> it's so crazy and easy to make money now
00:15 <jmalicki> i just don't trust the exchanges enough
00:15 <jmalicki> but it's probably waaay more profitable
00:15 <blablaa> jmalicki, there is the XBT provider ETN
00:15 <jmalicki> i'm only making like 8% a day, should be easy to do way better w/ btc
00:16 <jmalicki> (and no, that will not compound forever)
00:16 <jmalicki> there's only so much money you can throw at these trades
00:16 <jmalicki> btc however
00:16 <jmalicki> probably way more
00:18 <jmalicki> blablaa mine is more infrastructure insensitive since i have large machine learning models and looking at 1000s of symbols at once
00:18 <jmalicki> and dealing a lot now with making stuff robust to trades that get reported way late
00:18 <jmalicki> which it still does okay with, but it's out of design spec and fucks with a little bit
00:19 <jmalicki> since in historical data only the trade time is reported, not when the trade hits the consolidated tape
00:19 <jmalicki> blablaa nodejs?
00:19 <blablaa> jmalicki, python. your python too? python has good ML libraries
00:19 <jmalicki> blablaa no, only some of the glue code
00:20 <jmalicki> blablaa it has... easy to use consistent ml libraries
00:20 <jmalicki> not necessarily *good*
00:20 <jmalicki> blablaa i mean it's like comparing a honda civic to a formula one racer i guess
00:20 <jmalicki> not everyone wants to deal with maintaining a formula one racer
00:20 <jmalicki> but it has its place
00:21 <jmalicki> they have different kinds of good qualities
00:21 <blablaa> jmalicki, yeah
00:21 <jmalicki> but as reliable as it is, and low maintenance, a honda civic won't compete in formula one
00:21 <jmalicki> and easy to drive
00:25 <jmalicki> (but a formula one car needs a completely new engine every 250 miles https://www.carthrottle.com/post/5-reasons-why-you-cant-put-an-f1-engine-in-a-road-car/ )
00:25 <jmalicki> so different tradeoffs
00:29 <jmalicki> i'm using a combination of jvm and c++
00:29 <jmalicki> for various tradeoffs of ease of use and performance
00:29 <jmalicki> (i'm still high latency enough i can get away with jvm)
00:31 <blablaa> jmalicki, congrats, you do serious stuff
00:32 <jmalicki> blablaa meh i dunno
00:32 <jmalicki> i'm aiming high, and still flailing a bit
00:32 <jmalicki> but i also wanted to have some learning component to this
00:33 <jmalicki> i'm using a lot of akka and still barely understand it
00:33 <jmalicki> where a lot of the weirdness is coming in
00:33 <jmalicki> (why did the process just fail/hang?) etc
00:34 <jmalicki> blablaa in my experience the jvm is usually 20-30x faster than python
00:34 <jmalicki> for even simple stuff like parsing csvs
00:34 <jmalicki> so if python is working it's my favorite language
00:34 <jmalicki> but at some point it just becomes too painful
00:34 <jmalicki> Wegg++
00:35 <jmalicki> blablaa pypy is nice, and getting better all the time
00:35 <jmalicki> still not as fast as the jvm, but most of the way there
00:35 <Odyss3us> jmalicki: did you check out the CSH doc?
00:35 <jmalicki> have crypto exchanges ever cancelled trades in a flash crash?
00:36 <jmalicki> Odyss3us a little, that's why i asked about gov azure ;)
00:36 <Odyss3us> jmalicki: thought that might be in ref to http://mil.api.fit
00:36 <jmalicki> i just remembered reading in the news a few years ago that aws got an exclusive contract
00:36 <jmalicki> ah
00:37 <jmalicki> Odyss3us i skimmed CSH and decided it was dense enough it's not light reading
00:37 <jmalicki> Odyss3us it assumes a high level of knowledge in the area more than being technical i think?
00:37 <jmalicki> it made me feel like "i need a glossary"
00:38 <jmalicki> i'm technical, but crypto isn't my area, so i don't know the buzzwords etc
00:39 <jmalicki> Odysseus maybe also some headlines like "Legal Applications: Enhanced M&A Security to Minimize Leaks" etc or somrting
00:39 <jmalicki> so someone can scan in 3 seconds and decide whether they want to invest the time?
00:39 <Odyss3us> jmalicki: the time to talk to us yes
00:40 <jmalicki> or some random italics or bold
00:40 <jmalicki> Odyss3us since a typical investor probably sees hundreds of these and doesn't have the time to spend 15 minutes trying to understand it
00:40 <jmalicki> unless their interest is piqued
00:41 <jmalicki> yeah, i'm just giving my impression
00:41 <jmalicki> if i were in your position i'd want all the criticism i could get
00:41 <jmalicki> since by the time it crosses an investor it's too late, they either take it or leave it
00:42 <jmalicki> i also know personally i'd prefer more bullet points and less prose ;P
00:42 <jmalicki> maybe some numbers
00:42 <jmalicki> like "how much do m&a leaks cost investors?"
00:42 <jmalicki> that could get at TAM
00:43 <jmalicki> i'm sure others would say the total opposite too :-/
00:43 <jmalicki> i am a bit more quantitative than most
00:44 <jmalicki> also you misspelled theoretically ;P
00:45 <jmalicki> ;P
00:45 <jmalicki> odysseus sounds like cool stuff
00:45 <jmalicki> odysseus do you have a longer white paper?
00:46 <jmalicki> Odyss3us digging deeper my first question would be, what's the big difference between this and 90s-era smartcard technology?
00:47 <jmalicki> they sound the same at 50,000 ft
00:47 <jmalicki> (e.g. run your software on a secure usb stick)
00:48 <jmalicki> but maybe the people you're targeting already know all of this
11:13 <jmalicki> python476 most people probably aren't aware of Hawkes processes
11:13 <jmalicki> they're still pretty niche
11:14 <jmalicki> they're becoming increasingly popular though, but still small
11:14 <jmalicki> but growing fast
11:14 <jmalicki> i'm not sure if there are even any textbooks that cover hawkes processes?
11:16 <jmalicki> lol one monograph from 1980 that cites it but doesn't really cover
11:17 <jmalicki> i think 99% of hawkes process papers are from the past 5 years despite dating to 1970
11:17 <jmalicki> i'm making that up but thats what it feels like
11:17 <jmalicki> libgen?
11:19 <jmalicki> here's one https://books.google.com/books?id=KgCWNI7Js64C&pg=PA210&dq=hawkes+process&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiO_r2V1aLZAhWKg1QKHXHZA3MQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&q=hawkes%20process&f=false
11:37 <python476> jmalicki: if you want one very nice application of hawkes: https://people.csail.mit.edu/yujia/assets/pdf/hawkes_pdf.pdf (medicine)
11:37 <jmalicki> cool!!
11:39 <jmalicki> python476 i mean it makes sense, it's just a poisson process where an event can make recurrence more likely
11:39 <jmalicki> like for crime... crimes happen randomly , but once one happens you get copycats, etc
11:40 <jmalicki> python476 worth understanding poisson before hawkes ;)
11:40 <jmalicki> python476 poisson is just... every second, there is some probability of an event
11:41 <jmalicki> python476 a poisson distribution tells you how long the time between events are
11:41 <jmalicki> so then given a series of times between events you can guess the probability of an event happening at a given time
11:42 <jmalicki> err sorry, numer of events not time between
11:44 <jmalicki> so think about a restaurant
11:44 <jmalicki> if people walk by at a constant rate and randomly decide to go into a restaurant or not with some constant probability
11:45 <jmalicki> a poisson process models how many people are in the restaurant
11:45 <jmalicki> a hawkes process says that if people walk by and see lots of other people in the restaurant, then they might think it must be good and they'll go too
11:46 <jmalicki> a hawkes process models the thinking "if this restaurant has a line, i'm more likely to want to go there, since it must be good"
11:46 <jmalicki> as opposed to the number of people there just being random
11:46 <jmalicki> yeah sort of i guess :)
11:46 <jmalicki> that's kind of why it's used in hft i guess
11:47 <jmalicki> it can capture momentum or mean reversion
11:47 <jmalicki> depending on the sign of that term
11:50 <jmalicki> there was a book in 2008 about that python476
11:50 <jmalicki> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001MXK52M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1
11:51 <jmalicki> it includes maxwell's "on governers" as an appendix
11:51 <jmalicki> but it's not really like a scientific work, but interesting
11:52 <jmalicki> python476 the difference of hawkes process is that it's discrete
11:52 <jmalicki> and like with trades, you're measuring did a trade happen
11:52 <jmalicki> it's not necessarily continuous
11:53 <jmalicki> if you're looking at sufficiently high frequency data, it basically becomes quantum
11:53 <jmalicki> like you're looking at individual electrons jump
11:54 <jmalicki> usually looking at the order book is the equivalent of modeling individual atoms in the engine, not overall heat
11:55 <jmalicki> which is why discrete things like hawkes process are used, rather than like brownian motion that's used at higher levels
11:55 <jmalicki> "i just saw an electron go to a higher energy state, when will it happen again"
11:56 <jmalicki> but that's why it's advantageous
11:56 <jmalicki> because sometimes that provides an earlier picture of what will happen
11:58 <jmalicki> i'm not aware of any such thing being done, but it probably could be
11:58 <jmalicki> hawkes processes aren't markov
11:58 <jmalicki> markov models are much simpler
11:58 <jmalicki> oh i see some stuff like this markov renewal models https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00867113/document
12:01 <jmalicki> yeah, but non-markov is way better
12:01 <jmalicki> it's why people use LSTMs these days
12:01 <jmalicki> a markov process means you only look one into the past
12:01 <jmalicki> like the next word only depends on the previous word
12:01 <jmalicki> if it depends on everything said so far, it is non-markov
12:02 <jmalicki> like that's what markov means
12:02 <jmalicki> yeah it's a generalization
12:03 <jmalicki> python476 like P(Xn|X{n-1},X{n-2},...,X1) = P(Xn|X{n-1}) is the markov property
12:03 <jmalicki> and if someone says "this process is markov" that's what it means
12:03 <jmalicki> and k-order markov just extends that
12:04 <jmalicki> whereas say a hawkes process has an infinite memory
12:04 <jmalicki> also markov implies discrete time steps
12:05 <jmalicki> hawkes process models time as continuous
12:05 <jmalicki> those don't necessarily make it better, just different
12:05 <jmalicki> there's plenty of discrete time models in finance
12:06 <jmalicki> e.g. using binomial trees for pricing american options
12:06 <jmalicki> or my bot ;P
12:07 <jmalicki> lots of people seem to use it?
12:07 <jmalicki> ibttis often it's programmed into an fpga instead but ya
12:08 <jmalicki> ibttis you use an fpga because you want to start computing the hawkes process before you read the entire ethernet packet
12:09 <cuba> are you working as a quant jmalicki?
12:09 <jmalicki> i'm unemployed
12:09 <jmalicki> i was employed
12:09 <jmalicki> python476 serious fpga people tie their model in with the ethernet logic
12:10 <jmalicki> so they make an ethernet fpga
12:10 <jmalicki> and as soon as they read the byte with the price
12:10 <jmalicki> they start computing it
12:10 <jmalicki> and deciding whether or not to send out an order
12:10 <jmalicki> like they are decoding and processing the data real time, none of this first read a packet into a buffer, then decode it into an object, then process it
12:10 <jmalicki> too slow
12:11 <jmalicki> people also write code directly for like intel IXP network processors
12:11 <cuba> are you trading options/futures jmalicki?
12:11 <jmalicki> which many intel GBEs have
12:11 <python476> jmalicki: you mean the chip is only eth + fpga ?
12:11 <jmalicki> cuba equities
12:11 <jmalicki> python476 no.. they write the ethernet logic into the fpga
12:11 <jmalicki> python476 like you write the code for an ethernet nic
12:11 <jmalicki> custom
12:11 <jmalicki> and integrate your trading into it
12:12 <jmalicki> or you get someone else's source and modify it i guess
12:12 <jmalicki> prolly more common
12:12 <jmalicki> cuba not tellin
12:12 <jmalicki> nonparametric
12:12 <jmalicki> i have no idea what they're doing ;P
12:13 <jmalicki> order book data
12:13 <jmalicki> cuba it looks at all updates to the limit order book
12:13 <jmalicki> no idea what that is
12:15 <jmalicki> cuba oh no, they're anti-bot
12:16 <jmalicki> cuba in the last year if you have a bot directly hooked up to an exchange in the US, you need to be a FINRA registered broker dealer
12:16 <jmalicki> estimated costs of compliance between $200k-$5M per year depending
12:16 <jmalicki> you have to be licensed, bonded, fingerprinted
12:16 <jmalicki> etc
12:16 <jmalicki> cuba that is new hft regulation
12:16 <jmalicki> so best to go with a broker unless you're ready for all that
12:17 <jmalicki> cuba the only way i've found is to save it yourself
12:17 <jmalicki> no
12:18 <jmalicki> if you find a place to buy tell me
12:19 <jmalicki> cuba https://www.wilmerhale.com/pages/publicationsandnewsdetail.aspx?NewsPubId=17179876952
12:19 <jmalicki> "According to the Proposal, for instance, firms would spend approximately $3.3 million in implementation costs, which include FINRA application costs and costs to implement OATS reporting."
12:20 <jmalicki> cuba OATS reporting is basically sending a log of all your activities in realtime to the FINRA and SEC
12:20 <jmalicki> if you're in europe, there is MiFiD-II which is its own headache
12:20 <jmalicki> govts are making HFT bots a pain in the ass legally
12:21 <jmalicki> https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/blog/2017/07/25/mifid-ii-and-algorithmic-trading-what-you-need-to-know-now/
12:21 <jmalicki> ;P
12:22 <jmalicki> no
12:22 <jmalicki> cuba just... going directly against an exchange is highly regulated these days
12:22 <jmalicki> if you go through a broker you take a latency hit, but save yourself a gigantic legal hassle
12:23 <jmalicki> it's a tradeoff
12:23 <jmalicki> at least i only know about eu and us so far
12:23 <jmalicki> still investigating other markets
12:24 <jmalicki> cuba this is all very recent, a crackdown on the public saying "omfg do something about hft!"
12:30 <cuba> jmalicki: iextrading offers iex pcap data
12:31 <jmalicki> woah taht is fucking awesome
12:31 <jmalicki> cuba++
12:31 <jmalicki> cuba+=10e20
12:32 <jmalicki> cuba so i'm not a lawyer, and they seem to be encouraging people to directly use their api, so i don't know how this matches with the SEC regs about DMA
12:32 <jmalicki> this *sounds like* DMA to a layman?
12:34 <jmalicki> cuba also directly accessing an exchange usually means you're legally responsible for properly upholding things like Reg-NMS
12:34 <jmalicki> yourself
12:34 <jmalicki> it can be pretty dangerous
12:35 <jmalicki> i wouldn't touch it without talking to a US securities lawyer...
12:35 <jmalicki> because the regulations around directly talking to an exchange are fucking insane
12:37 <cuba> jmalicki: I am not doing any HFT at the moment
12:47 <python476> jmalicki: ever used clojure ?
12:47 <jmalicki> a little bbit, not my favorite :)
12:47 <jmalicki> cool
12:48 <jmalicki> python476 python is my favorite language but it's slow
12:48 <jmalicki> like just soooo painfullly slow
22:24 <jmalicki> it lets them steal your money
22:25 <jmalicki> it's why it's important you can afford to lose it
00:32 <jmalicki> huh https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2972979
00:32 <jmalicki> maybe the volpocalypse was engineered?
01:38 <jmalicki> the matriarchy uses fiat
01:56 <jmalicki> weeeee, redownloading all my historical data with the options that let me see if trades came from lit exchanges :-/
02:12 <python476> how large is that download jmalicki ?
02:13 <jmalicki> about 17G
02:13 <jmalicki> but it's also slow
02:13 <jmalicki> involves lots of processing
02:13 <jmalicki> not just like a file
02:15 <jmalicki> python476 with stochastic rsi you're looking for it to reach 0?
02:15 <jmalicki> as an indicator?
02:15 <jmalicki> i dunno much about stochastic rsi
02:18 <jmalicki> python476 i would guess so, it's simple calculus
02:18 <jmalicki> they might not call it stochastic rsi
02:22 <jmalicki> ugh, now NASDAQ is starting to crack down on data APIs
02:22 <jmalicki> at least they're not 5 figures/mo
02:23 <jmalicki> python476 the real issue w/ the data is it takes 2 days to load into my db :-/
02:26 <jmalicki> 24 core xeon
02:27 <jmalicki> indices, summaries, etc. all that
02:29 <jmalicki> ibttis cooling sucks
02:29 <jmalicki> ibttis that's why iceland, it's cold and you have geothermal
02:30 <jmalicki> no, of the mining machines
02:30 <jmalicki> could be done, but the ideal is cheap power in a cold climate, if you can get it
02:31 <jmalicki> looooool
02:31 <jmalicki> ibttis i guess if you don't feed them you don't have to worry about that cost
02:32 <jmalicki> ibttis or the russian nuclear scientists using their research reactors and supercomputers for mining
02:32 <jmalicki> http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43003740
02:35 <jmalicki> python476 sure, but that's easy to do
02:35  * jmalicki ducks
04:40 <jmalicki> Just shotr
18:22 <jmalicki> Wegg: this is #econometrics, econometrics is methods to analyze the economy, not the economy
18:22 <jmalicki> it's a good channel for people bored by the economy
18:26 <jmalicki> it's more like an investment in Madoff Securities to me
18:27 <jmalicki> Randolf what about it?
18:27 <jmalicki> they provide cute error pages
18:28 <Randolf> jmalicki:  It's annoying because it delays entry to every web page.
18:28 <jmalicki> Randolf huh?  It makes entry faster
18:28 <jmalicki> Randolf what delay?
18:29 <jmalicki> Randolf huh? It bbrings the site 100ms closer to you
18:29 <jmalicki> Randolf what 3 second delay?
18:29  * Randolf ignores jmalicki
18:30  * jmalicki has no idea what Randolf is talking about?
18:30 <Randolf> jmalicki:  Are you trying to screw with me?
18:31 <jmalicki> no, i don't...  cloudflare is about bringing content closer, i don't know what 3s delay you're talking about?
18:31 <jmalicki> oh, cloudflare is giving you captchas?
18:31 <irrgit> lol i guess jmalicki hasnt seen that checking your browsers spinning wheel before
18:32 <jmalicki> oh right that... i see it when i go to bitcoin sites that are constantly getting hacked
18:32 <jmalicki> but the bitcoin sites need the protection cloudflare offers
18:32 <jmalicki> irrgit i forgot about that
18:32 <jmalicki> i don't go to bitcoin sites often
18:33 <jmalicki> Randolf sure but that's a tiny fraction of the time you use cloudflare
18:34 <Randolf> jmalicki:  On a web site like Amazon.com, or any Canadian Government web site, and the vast majority of web sites, I don't have to wait 3 seconds -- the pages just come up and following menu items leads to pages that just come up.  No problem.  I don't like having to wait 3 seconds for every page to
18:35 <jmalicki> RAndolf yes, and *most of the time you use cloudflare* you don't wait 3 seconds
18:35 <jmalicki> that delay appears when the website is under constant attack
18:35 <jmalicki> so it's either a 3s delay or the site is down
18:35 <jmalicki> still makes sense to look for an alternative
18:36 <jmalicki> but that isn't normal operation for cloudflare
18:36 <jmalicki> under normal operation you have no indication you're using cloudflare, like every time you visit stackexchange.com
18:37 <ossifrage> jmalicki, part of the problem with cloudflare seems to be dealing with real time data
18:37 <jmalicki> Randolf but all the other times you use cloudflare, you never see it
18:38 <jmalicki> Randolf if you ever go to say stackexchange.com you're using it
18:38 <jmalicki> or yelp.com
18:39 <jmalicki> ossifrage a big problem is that it gets inserted if the *site isn't keeping up with load*
18:39 <jmalicki> ossifrage so it's not cloudflare that's the issue, it just moves it from one place to another
18:40 <jmalicki> it replaces a hung browser with bouncy balls
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf yes... but it uses CloudFlare
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf you don't see it because the site isn't teetering on collapse
18:40 <jmalicki> so the bouncy balls aren't displayed
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf but every request you make to stackexchange is going through cloudflare
18:42 <ossifrage> jmalicki, cloudflare was triggering rate limiting from minimal use of the site (like having one trading window open and trying to open the funding page)
18:45 <jmalicki> ossifrage usually it starts to become waay more picky when the entire site is being slammed
18:46 <jmalicki> oh hmm stackexchange stopped using them
18:47 <Randolf> jmalicki:  Probably because people found it annoying?
18:47 <jmalicki> Randolf the UI you see with the delay is annoying
18:47 <jmalicki> Randolf probably because it was giving away people's passwords
18:47 <jmalicki> Randolf "inserting a delay with bouncing balls or captchas" is not what cloudflare does
18:47 <jmalicki> that's a third-order effect
18:48 <jmalicki> that's what they do *when they're visible*
18:54 <jmalicki> cloudflare is also a bit dumber for sites like bittrex that don't have static content
18:56 <jmalicki> Wegg maybe someone wants to sell
21:45 <jmalicki> Wegg "I'd be down with debtor's prison" you mean you want the state to prevent lenders from being paid back?
01:17 <jmalicki> marginal_ become a thiel fellow
01:19 <marginal_> jmalicki, i read about that, it's just your standard incubator
01:54 <jmalicki> LilBastard i've done both, sensory deprivation *plus the right focus* can do it
01:55 <jmalicki> LilBastard the nice thing about LSD is it teaches you what tripping is like, it becomes easier to get close yourself
01:55 <jmalicki> not quite the same
01:55 <jmalicki> oh none of them are lol?
02:50 <notmike> jmalicki bright all you damn cripto traders
02:51 <jmalicki> notmike i'm not a crypto trader!!
02:51 <jmalicki> so like crypto has huuuge possibilities
02:51 <notmike> jmalicki: are you about to offer me a job?
02:52 <jmalicki> that vol is sooo high compared to return means it needs crazy market making
02:52 <python476> jmalicki: more like tremendous
02:52 <jmalicki> notmike i can't do that at this point, i'm just talking about incorporating tomorrow
02:53 <notmike> jmalicki: congrats! I've been meaning to ask you, how is return usually calculated wrt Kelly criterion? É[ret]/std.dev. but is that E[ret] just the price or...
02:54 <jmalicki> notmike R[ret] is your predictred return
02:54 <jmalicki> notmike R[ret] like if you can backtest, like your backtested return
02:54 <jmalicki> notmike stdev is also sqrt(E[ret^2])
02:55 <jmalicki> kelly is also E[ret]/std.dev^2
02:55 <jmalicki> sharpe ration is E[ret]/std.dev
02:55 <jmalicki> notmike sure, or use your backtest etc.
02:56 <jmalicki> notmike if you have a systematized trading strategy, you apply it to old prices and see what your outcomes are
02:56 <jmalicki> like i would buy here, sell there
02:56 <jmalicki> how much return, how much sd
02:57 <jmalicki> depends onthe house advantage
02:57 <jmalicki> generally the stock market goes up, so that at least helps you
02:57 <jmalicki> since the house advantage is in your favor
02:58 <jmalicki> notmike that's all a temporary thing. everyone can put in the work to acquire knowledge
02:58 <jmalicki> some people have the luck to have a childhood where they're on a good point, of course
02:58 <jmalicki> but anyone can do it
02:58 <notmike> jmalicki: in the SR it seems evident to trade when markets favor your position. You have an edge, but quantifying the edge may be difficult.
02:59 <jmalicki> notmike this is where machine learning comes in
02:59 <jmalicki> notmike learn calculus and linear algebra, then watch andrew ng's coursera course
03:00 <python476> btw jmalicki if you're into FP, someone dropped a weird way to encode RNN in a paper
03:05 <jmalicki> taylor series is big in quant finance
03:05 <jmalicki> or any sort of applied math
03:05 <jmalicki> it allows you to approximate almost anything with a parabola
03:05 <jmalicki> (locally, at least)
03:06 <python476> jmalicki: Im still looking for the invention of taylor polynomials
03:07 <jmalicki> python476 https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/472960/prove-taylor-expansion-with-mean-value-theorem
03:08 <python476> jmalicki: thanks
03:08 <notmike> jmalicki: right. Can't I basically just plug in points, define some function, and differentiate that function to estimate the local behavior?
03:08 <jmalicki> notmike yeppers
03:08 <jmalicki> notmike or even do finite differences
03:09 <notmike> jmalicki: why do you give the knowledge away for free?
03:10 <jmalicki> notmike this is extremely general not directly applicable to making money etc
03:10 <jmalicki> notmike also i'm far enough up the foodchain that the more people have lightweight knowledge, the more my value increases
03:11 <jmalicki> notmike since i can then get you to the next level for money ;P
03:11 <jmalicki> it's like the first hit's free
03:11 <python476> jmalicki, your sciencing dealer
03:12 <jmalicki> i'm giving you enough knowledge to get yourself into problems i'm interested in being paid to get you out of ;P
03:12 <notmike> jmalicki: have you heard of TD time indicator?
03:13 <jmalicki> no
03:13 <notmike> jmalicki: let's get this money!
03:15 <jmalicki> louipc read this book https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Wilmott-Introduces-Quantitative-Finance/dp/0470319585
03:15 <jmalicki> then a few more detailed ones
03:16 <notmike> jmalicki recommended some really long comic book to me, but I leaned some shit
03:16 <louipc> jmalicki: is it like the mit students blackjack player club
03:16 <jmalicki> notmike logicomix?
03:16 <jmalicki> louipc no... you should read up on edward thorpe, the first quant hedge fund manager who also founded the mit blackjack team
03:17 <jmalicki> i don't think that was me
03:17 <louipc> jmalicki: i mean they developed a proven system right
03:17 <jmalicki> oh he has comic type stuff
03:17 <jmalicki> louipc yeah
03:18 <jmalicki> louipc no
03:18 <jmalicki> louipc depends
03:18 <jmalicki> louipc high five figures can do some stuff
03:18 <jmalicki> louipc with high five/low six figures there's plenty of stuff not worth the big boys' time
03:19 <jmalicki> if you have a billion, so many profitable things are just not worth your time
03:24 <python476> jmalicki: in stddev formula, does the squaring factor have any reasoning behind other than scaling up differences ?
03:37 <jmalicki> python476 sqrt(x^2) is basically abs(x)
03:37 <jmalicki> sort of
03:37 <jmalicki> it's different, but that's a big part of the basic idea
03:37 <jmalicki> it's a version of abs(x) that's nicer for calculus
03:37 <jmalicki> python476 abs is not smooth and very hard for calculus
03:38 <jmalicki> the derivative is the same everywhere in each half of the line, then changes infinitely
03:38 <jmalicki> where sqrt(x^2) is a convex smooth relaxation of abs(x)
03:38 <jmalicki> err no that's bullshit python476 :)
03:38 <jmalicki> not sure why
03:39 <jmalicki> i was totally wrong above i've been drinking
03:45 <jmalicki> python476 sqrt(x^2) is *equal* to abs(x)
03:46 <jmalicki> no convex relaxation
03:55 <notmike> jmalicki doesn't want notmike to have gainz :(
03:55 <jmalicki> notmike ?
18:37 <jmalicki> Shigufurido but lambos aren't electric, so  they're not allowed to drive fast
18:37 <jmalicki> Shigufurido in california you need to have an electric car to be allowed in the fast lane
18:37 <jmalicki> or a passenger
18:38 <jeffree> jmalicki: that's not really true?
18:38 <jmalicki> jeffree it is
18:39 <jmalicki> jeffree you need one of these stickers, or a passenger https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm
18:39 <jmalicki> jeffree there are some experiments where you can also pay a toll instead
18:40 <jmalicki> as long as you're rolling coal
18:41 <jmalicki> jeffree hmm, where does global warming come in?
18:42 <jmalicki> jeffree umm, a lot of it is just having breathable air
18:42 <jmalicki> so you don't have to breath in this http://www.jiffylubesocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/smog.jpg
18:44 <jmalicki> it's the density plus the mountains that trap the pollution in
19:03 <jmalicki> jeffree that's way lower than 32%
19:03 <jmalicki> jeffree if he had a 32% daily average he'd have 7.5 * 10^22 dollars
19:03 <jmalicki> whatever that is
19:04 <jmalicki> jeffree even 2.4% daily average gets you past $1M
19:04 <jmalicki> from $15k
19:05 <jmalicki> so math is proof he's just making shit up
19:05 <jmalicki> yeah bbut it ain't 32%
19:05 <jmalicki> maybe it's 3.2%
19:05 <ossifrage_> jmalicki, he could be claiming 32%/day on what he risks per day, but that is still unlikely
19:06 <ossifrage_> jmalicki, even 3.2%/day for 200 days would yield more then $1M starting from $15K
19:07 <jmalicki> ossifrage_ yep
19:08 <jmalicki> so then sell
19:09 <python476> jmalicki: you know about DickeyFuller and Hurst ? https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Basics-of-Statistical-Mean-Reversion-Testing
19:10 <jmalicki> meh fuck hypothesis testing
20:01 <jmalicki> Worry about dickey Fuller tests not missing out
20:01 <jmalicki> There will always be a boom
20:01 <jmalicki> Be prepared to be on top of the next one
20:02 <jmalicki> Don't worry about missing out
20:34 <jmalicki> python476 i have no specific issue with D-F, i just think hypothesis tests are not the way to go
20:34 <jmalicki> incorporate all possibilities into your model and train appropriately
20:34 <jmalicki> i'm just deeply a Bayesian
20:34 <jmalicki> and any sort of "test" is very un-Bayesian
20:35 <jmalicki> python476 but D-F tests are way more useful than speculating whether btc will be up or down today ;P
22:50 <jmalicki> moriarty consequences like replacement of the legal entity with a new one and everyone getting $0.01 for every $100 they lost...
22:50 <jmalicki> the lawyers would win
22:50 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol!!
23:24 <jmalicki> LilBastard: who do you think holds other countries' gold reserves?
23:25 <jmalicki> LilBastard: for instance Germany keeps half its good in the basement of the New York Fed
23:26 <jmalicki> Gold not good
23:26 <jmalicki> Lol
23:26 <blablaa> jmalicki, when a country is buying gold, it's about to go into crisis
23:26 <blablaa> jmalicki, correlation isn't causation but it's fun :D
23:26 <jmalicki> :)
01:22 <jmalicki> cool, someone did a good writeup that helps sell my strategy http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/
01:23 <jmalicki> PoS == piece of shit?
01:24 <notmike> jmalicki: PoS rewards ICOs for taking the underlying in return for worthless shit tokens and then holding the underlying.
01:26 <jmalicki> notmike++
22:10 <notmike> Nah, loose and smells like hotdog water. jmalicki knows!
22:28 <jmalicki> Ohio is loose can confirm
01:35 <notmike> It's ok. South gonna rise again. jmalicki knows! ;)
23:47 <jmalicki> what's an AON?
23:47 <jmalicki> CFO of a microsoft division to vp of aon sounds like a downward step?
00:57 <python476> cryptotrash: I have a computing degree, but I have a strong math envy (hence my questions to jmalicki)
00:57 <jmalicki> python476 so study math!!!
00:57 <jmalicki> python476 UWash and Columbia both have good part-time grad programs in applied math
00:58 <jmalicki> well, not highly ranked, but adequate ;P
00:58 <jmalicki> also Stanford CME via SCPD
00:58 <jmalicki> project euler!
00:59 <jmalicki> python476 where are you located?
00:59 <jmalicki> i get the impression france is elitist and wouldn't let someone learn something like that part time
00:59 <jmalicki> but could be wrong
01:00 <jmalicki> like can you just take a class at Paris IX?
01:00 <python476> jmalicki: it's fuzzy, they might not let you willy nilly but a year tuition is 500€
01:00 <jmalicki> python476 oh in the US it's like $5000 per class but they're open to letting you
01:01 <jmalicki> cryptotrash they probably won't stop you if you look the part, but getting your work graded etc. is harder
01:01 <jmalicki> oh Paris IX is management? woah
01:02 <jmalicki> python476 no, i thought some famous people came from there, maye i have it mixed up
01:03 <jmalicki> louipc paris is very famous for math
01:06 <jmalicki> deep learning is a bubble
01:07 <jmalicki> loool
01:08 <solidfox> jmalicki: could be
01:09 <jmalicki> lol
01:09 <solidfox> jmalicki: maybe the motley fool is recomending it so that they can sell off their shares?
01:09 <jmalicki> solidfox bubbles usually go up for awhile before the crash
01:18 <jmalicki> it was a long running joke for a long time that the only people who could make deep learning work spoke french
01:19 <jmalicki>  but then it got democratized
01:19 <jmalicki> (mostly a reference to yann lecun and the university of montreal)
01:21 <jmalicki> 70% is not very dark
01:21 <jmalicki> i go for 85
01:21 <python476> jmalicki: 70% is my spot, 85 is so dry
01:25 <jmalicki> tomorrow is when the president of the US comes out of the white house
01:25 <jmalicki> and if he sees his shadow there's another year of bullshit
01:26 <python476> jmalicki: what's up for trump
01:26 <jmalicki> python476 oh us school kids are dying because the fbi is too busy investigating russian spies
20:42 <jmalicki> [fade] not overprinting, the right amount of printing
20:42 <jmalicki> the dollar is losing value, so it means the policy is successful
20:42 <jmalicki> if the dollar were to gain or maintain value we'd need to replace the government
20:43 <solidfox> jmalicki, so venezuela must be like the #1 government then?
20:43 <jmalicki> louipc because an inflating currency leads to a more productive economy
20:43 <jmalicki> louipc noone can rest on their asses
20:43 <jmalicki> solidfox well, inflating currency isn't the *only* purpose of government
20:43 <jmalicki> just one of the larger ones
20:44 <moriarty> as2333, yeah as jmalicki pointed out, if you're a saver you would be better off in bitcoin, and if you're a borrower, you're better off in fiat, so that has interesting consequences for the economy although given the penetration rate of crypto folks is still single digit percentages at about 4% in
20:44 <jmalicki> in large, uninvested saving is bad for the economy
20:45 <jmalicki> like, you produce lots of food and then store it in cans
20:45 <jmalicki> that's food that could support more people that could be productive
20:45 <jmalicki> etc
20:46 <moriarty> jmalicki, indeed
20:46 <jmalicki> if you have a deflationary currency, rather than hire productive workers, you want to keep your currency
20:46 <jmalicki> leading to less stuff being made
20:46 <moriarty> jmalicki, however i'm not too worried as most of these funds do get reinvested in blockchain tech and its wider ecosystem, through ICOs etc
20:47 <jmalicki> moriarty i'm skeptical, i mean i see that happening, but a deflationary currency will do that
20:47 <jmalicki> "NoImNotNineVolt> (but even metal-backed currencies were inflationary)" nope
20:47 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: wat
20:47 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt the amount of gold didn't keep up with the demand for money, thus deflationary
20:47 <jmalicki> it doesn't matter if the amount of gold increases
20:48 <jmalicki> it matters if it increases at pace with the economy
20:48 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: that depends about when/where you're talking about. there definitely were periods of economic growth where the increase in economy size outpaced in increase in currency.
20:48 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt that is true, but i'm talking over long-term
20:48 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: but there were also periods of economic contraction that didn't coincide with coin being removed from circulation, etc.
20:49 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt at least in the US from 1776 through 1930
20:50 <jmalicki> as2333 it's gone up
20:50 <as2333> jmalicki, lawl
20:51 <jmalicki> as2333 an original mint condition apple ii is pretty expensive these days
20:51 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: any electrolytic capacitors in there that haven't failed yet soon will :P
20:51 <jmalicki> gears true, that label only applies to the private sector
20:52 <as2333> jmalicki, so you know you don't have a leg to stand on
20:52 <jmalicki> as2333 the same computer hardware does increase in price over time
20:52 <jmalicki> as it becomes more rare
20:52 <jmalicki> any notion of falling prices requires some notion of substitution
20:52 <as2333> jmalicki, let mw know if you ever have anything serious to say
20:54 <jmalicki> louipc "but really what happens if you go to the bank and try to take out some money" they say no, you can't do that
20:58 <jmalicki> louipc steal it
21:08 <jmalicki> 1% per day is not small
21:09 <jmalicki> if you earn 1% per day for 5 years, you can go from $1000 to the richest person in the world
21:09 <python476> jmalicki: why is everybody use the same "richest person of the world" idiom
21:10 <jmalicki> python476 it's a reasonable focal point
21:11 <python476> jmalicki: it's not applicable anyway, you cant scalp the more you have
21:12 <jmalicki> python476 it is showing how much 1% is
22:29 <jmalicki> grillin: easy, avoid anything crypto
22:29 <grillin> jmalicki :) i've already invest in plenty icos
00:51 <jmalicki> i read black swans and the other older one... imo he's a bit hysterical
00:51 <jmalicki> like, "omg they're using the normal distribution and it's wrong" no shit
00:51 <jmalicki> all models are wrong
07:32 <jmalicki> yeah, like self-driving fleets of tractors
19:45 <jmalicki> buckwild it is
19:45 <jmalicki> buckwild but it turns out people spend way more on healthcare, education, and housing than lcd tvs
19:46 <jmalicki> buckwild it's inflation unless you use the evil manipulations the US govt uses that people get so upset about (hedonic adjustment)
19:47 <jmalicki> buckwild but they're doing the things you want
19:47 <jmalicki> which is why libertarians think they're shit
19:47 <jmalicki> buckwild you stated it
19:48 <jmalicki> yes.. spoken like a true libertarian focused on logic not truth
19:48 <jmalicki> buckwild the rest of the world sees statements of truth when you ask a question
19:49 <jmalicki> human language is not first order logic
19:49 <jmalicki> one can go far if one learns human language
19:49 <as2333> jmalicki, don't logic and truth go hand in hand?
19:49 <jmalicki> as2333 wtf does truth have to do with logic?
19:49 <jeffree> jmalicki: interpretation exists
19:49 <as2333> jmalicki, people who say ilogicall things are lying.
19:50 <as2333> jmalicki, so that's one connection
19:50 <jmalicki> as2333 how so?
19:50 <jmalicki> as2333 i mean, we have goedel's imcompleteness theorem which logically proves truth need not be logical
19:50 <jmalicki> so if you accept logic, you have to accept that truth need not be logical
19:51 <as2333> jmalicki, joe killed his wife and he didn't kill his wife. <--- how true is that? Where's the truth there?
19:51 <jmalicki> if you say that truth must be logical, you are rejecting logic
19:51 <as2333> jmalicki, i don't think so.
19:51 <jmalicki> as2333 study more logic
19:51 <as2333> jmalicki, and I doubt that was goedels point either
19:51 <jmalicki> as2333 that is exactly the point
19:52 <as2333> jmalicki, and I don't think you are in any position to tell me to 'study logic' =)
19:52 <jmalicki> there exist truthful statements that cannot be shown by logic
19:52 <as2333> jmalicki, I mean of course you can say whatever you want but....
19:52 <jmalicki> i'm well versed in logic, i just don't think it's all that usefu
19:52 <as2333> jmalicki, that's a different things altogether.
19:52 <jmalicki> useful
19:52 <as2333> jmalicki, I never said that anything '
19:53 <jmalicki> however you did imply true things must be logical
19:53 <jmalicki> as2333 that is EXACTLY the assertion goedel disproved
19:53 <as2333> jmalicki, I dont think so
19:54 <as2333> jmalicki, so with out recourse to goedels 'authority' your comment on libertarians seems rather unproven or outright absurd =)
19:54 <as2333> jmalicki, most libertarisn are non libertarian frauds anyway.
19:54 <jmalicki> it's a recourse to logic, not authority
19:54 <jmalicki> the argument stands on its own through logic
19:54 <jmalicki> as it was disproved through logic
19:55 <jmalicki> so if one accepts logic, one must accept that truth need not be logical
19:55 <as2333> jmalicki, I dont think your understanding of logic is corect and your attempt to apply it to 'libertaians' is even more flawed.
19:55 <jmalicki> as2333 you could benefit from studying logic...
19:57 <as2333> jmalicki, there's some sort of story about goedel and 'american' 'law' ?
19:57 <jmalicki> this is a good book https://www.google.com/search?q=enderton+logic&oq=enderton+logic&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j0l2j69i61j0.1712j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
19:57 <jmalicki> as2333 i'm not aware of any connection between goedel and american law
19:59 <jmalicki> as2333 he has nothing to do with the us constitution, only logic
19:59 <jmalicki> as2333 hah
20:01 <jmalicki> as2333 well, that was not widely peer reviewed
20:01 <as2333> jmalicki, the hell does peer review got to do with anyting? =)
20:02 <jmalicki> as2333 a chance for others to find logical holes in the argument
20:02 <as2333> jmalicki, so you were not aware of goedels 'skepticism' of the US constitution. Now you are?
20:02 <jmalicki> yep now i am
20:03 <as2333> jmalicki, so it turns out that goedels 'incompletness stuff' is at some philosophical level an argument agaisnt totalitarians and their governments.
20:03 <jmalicki> as2333 umm not really
20:04 <jmalicki> it's a logical theorem that stands on its own
20:04 <jmalicki> apart from any beliefs goedel may or may not have
20:04 <jmalicki> if i prove the pythagorean theorem
20:04 <jmalicki> then state i believe in polygamy
20:05 <jmalicki> that doesn't mean the pythagorean theorem implies polygamy...
20:05 <jmalicki> goedel's statements on the constitution are at best loosely connected to his incompleteness theore
20:05 <as2333> jmalicki, anyway, your comment about libertarians is absurd and unfounded.
20:06 <as2333> jmalicki, and may I ask, what's your political philosophy?
20:06 <jmalicki> nihilism
20:12 <as2333> jmalicki, come to think of it, do you mind mentioning some startement that is true but not logical?
20:31 <jmalicki> if the USAF has a Cyber "wing", why is the USN's cyber forces not called a "fleet"?
20:31 <jmalicki> yay yay correlation go away!
20:32 <jmalicki> NotImNotNineVolt fed rates don't necessarily affect mortgage rates
20:32 <jmalicki> NotImNotNineVolt that's what happened in 2007... the fed kept trying to raise rates, but mortgage rates stayed low
20:32 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: yea this isn't 2007 :P
20:32 <jmalicki> since they were only directly mucking around with short term rates
20:33 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt well, the fed rates won't necessarily change mortgage rates, there are other capital forces out there
20:33 <jmalicki> raising rates on the short end could just flatten the yield curve
20:33 <jmalicki> of course in practice, given the fed's current books
20:34 <jmalicki> they're probably going to pull out of QE at some piont, which will directly affect longer debt
20:35 <jmalicki> they bounce around within 10% all the time
20:36 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt it'll be a real affect when mortgages go to 6, 7, 8%
20:36 <jmalicki> ;P
20:36 <jmalicki> https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US
20:37 <jmalicki> by historic standards any time in the last 10 years is epically low
20:38 <jmalicki> well ok 8.5 years ;P
20:38 <jmalicki> ya
20:39 <jmalicki> when things go up they can go up quite quickly
20:39 <jmalicki> like stocks rise slowly, fall fast
20:39 <jmalicki> opposite for rates as rates and prices are inverse
20:40 <jmalicki> i mean, the current rates are the market's best prediction anyway
20:40 <jmalicki> it means a lot of people expect them to be very low for a very long time
20:42 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt or immediately preceding flat markets
20:43 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt you could buy UST options
20:43 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: i have other hedges.
20:43 <jmalicki> there's always another side of the bet
20:43 <jmalicki> if there's not someone who disagrees with you there's no point in acting
20:44 <jmalicki> i've just come to the belief that things never follow fundamentals
20:44 <jmalicki> i assume what the economy does will be absolutely nonsensical
20:45 <jmalicki> buckwild we'll have to sell more debt
20:45 <jmalicki> buckwild it's a way better investment than bitcoin
20:46 <jmalicki> buckwild because it's like going to best buy and getting a special financing deal on the TV you can't afford
20:46 <jmalicki> we can't afford to buy all of the things we import, so they give us a special financing deal
20:46 <jmalicki> so we buy more of their shit
20:47 <jmalicki> "i can't afford $2000, but $20/mo for 10 years? sure why not"
20:48 <jmalicki> they don't buy from fed auctions
20:48 <jmalicki> they buy from treasury auctions
20:48 <jmalicki> most of the debt is domestically held anyway
20:50 <jmalicki> buckwild like Social Security owns more than twice the US debt that china does
20:51 <jmalicki> perhaps Social Security should try investing in something else
20:53 <jmalicki> i mean sure intra-agency liabilities are sort of a legal fiction
20:54 <buckwild> jmalicki, you're very opinionate and mostly wrong about the US stuff ive seen you write.  Does that have anything to do with you being in a european time zone?
20:55 <jmalicki> buckwild more just being stupid
20:56 <buckwild> jmalicki, it seems to come naturally for you, bravo, that is a special talent.
00:01 <jmalicki> moriarty on the contrary, btc has some of the strongest mean reversion one can find
00:03 <jmalicki> the only problem is that taking advantage of the mean reversion takes using a fly by night crypto brokerage like coinbase or bitfinex
00:03 <moriarty> jmalicki, it depends on which phase, that's clearly not true given that bitcoin's price has been persistently higher since its inception
00:03 <jmalicki> moriarty there's a strong trend, but extremely high oscillation around the tren
00:03 <jmalicki> trend
00:04 <jmalicki> you can make quite a bit from playing the oscillations
00:04 <jmalicki> btc sharpe ratio is tiny, meaning it's not a smooth trend
00:04 <moriarty> jmalicki, right, so that's not really mean reversion :) but sure
00:05 <jmalicki> moriarty the oscillations are quite strong compared to the overall trend
00:08 <jmalicki> the graph of bitcoin prices is what it looks like when you don't have a functional market making business in an asset
00:08 <jmalicki> meaning whoever makes it happen can make a lot of money
00:09 <moriarty> jmalicki, indeed
00:10 <jmalicki> marginal_ it's synonymous with vampire squid
00:11 <moriarty> jmalicki, https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/02/20/cryptocurrency-investors-wade-into-dark-pools/
00:11 <jmalicki> vampire squid is goldman sachs
00:11 <jmalicki> moriarty++
00:11 <moriarty> jmalicki, your comment reminded me of that news
00:11 <jmalicki> whale sharks are actual sharks i thought
00:12 <moriarty> jmalicki, i'm already picking up lots of interest from large buyers and sellers
04:32 <jmalicki> culture it's possible, within an epsilon, just hard
04:32 <jmalicki> culture study and you can do it!
04:33 <jmalicki> culture i can make you a study program approximating abbout 3 years of full time university study
04:33 <jmalicki> i am
04:37 <sleepinn> jmalicki do you do forex
04:39 <jmalicki> sleepinn no us equities
04:39 <jmalicki> sleepinn people get obsessed over the leverage of forex
04:39 <jmalicki> but usually they're taking on way too much risk for return
04:39 <jmalicki> sleepinn and also the brokerages usually make the house advantage high
04:40 <jmalicki> many forex brokers take larger cuts than the best
04:40 <jmalicki> sleepinn if you really know what you're doing it can be ok, but for most people it's basically like playing roullette
04:40 <sleepinn> what's better jmalicki
04:40 <jmalicki> sleepinn it's possible to win big, but not likely... be sure you backtest etc. first
04:41 <jmalicki> sleepinn whatever you do, backtest
04:41 <jmalicki> sleepinn and know when things have changed so the conditions of your backtest no longer apply to get out
04:42 <jmalicki> but the high leverage of forex is like being able to put all your money on  one number in roulette
04:42 <jmalicki> like, you could win, what is it, 28x your bet?
04:42 <jmalicki> but you're probably gonna lose it all
04:43 <jmalicki> the best is probably then s&p 500 index funds
04:43 <jmalicki> or total market index funds
04:43 <jmalicki> plus some bond etc. exposure
04:44 <jmalicki> so you'd rather support the prison-military-industrial complex? since that's the other option
04:44 <jmalicki> it's either enterprises or oppressive governments
04:44 <jmalicki> yep
04:45 <jmalicki> if you're not supporting enterprises, you're supporting the police state and prisons and colonialism quite directly
04:45 <jmalicki> if you support enterprises, you're instead supporting getting food to people who need it, transportation so families can visit each other, etc
04:46 <jmalicki> sleepinn you're making it cheaper for the US to finance the debt they use to overthrow governments of other countries, yes
04:47 <jmalicki> whereas if you buy stock of greyhound, you make it easier for far-flung families to visit each other
04:47 <jmalicki> sleepinn to other parts of the government, banks, other countries like china and saudi arabia, etc
04:48 <jmalicki> sleepinn does it matter if they give a fuck? the families benefit
04:48 <jmalicki> sleepinn are they instead like governments, who are actively trying to imprison people and break up families?
04:49 <jmalicki> sleepinn which country are you in? they're a us based entity
04:50 <jmalicki> i don't know what's available in france
04:51 <jmalicki> but you can choose companies you think are overall doing good
04:51 <jmalicki> i mean they may not be charities, or care about families
04:51 <jmalicki> but if they're say, growing food ethically
04:51 <jmalicki> that is perhaps enough
04:52 <jmalicki> i only really know US
04:52 <jmalicki> usually your broker holds them
04:52 <jmalicki> but if you want them long-term you can usually request a certificate you hold yourself for a small fee
04:52 <jmalicki> that's the easiest way
04:52 <jmalicki> if you have a certificate you need to make sure you don't lose it
04:52 <jmalicki> which is hard
04:53 <jmalicki> well you can, but like btc if you lose the wallet you're screwed
04:53 <jmalicki> you can get a piece of paper that says you own it
04:53 <jmalicki> but you then need to be sure you don't lose or destroy the piece of paper
04:54 <jmalicki> whereas usually the broker can recover your account if you lose something, and has good safeguards on their own
04:54 <jmalicki> personally TA, but that takes TONS of work
04:54 <jmalicki> and education
04:54 <jmalicki> and isn't easy
04:54 <jmalicki> for most people index funds are the best option imo
04:54 <jmalicki> to do better takes TONS of work
04:55 <jmalicki> functional analysis, machine learning, tensorflow, xgboost, c++, scala, postgres, Apache Spark, fourier analysis, wavelets, nonlinear regression, time series, etc etc etc
04:56 <jmalicki> 60 hrs/wk doing TA
04:56 <jmalicki> culture watch out for wash sales depending on what you're trading
04:57 <sleepinn> I work 7h à week jmalicki
04:57 <jmalicki> sleepinn that's cool.. just saying TA is very hard work
04:57 <jmalicki> it can be very profitable, but the bar is high
04:58 <jmalicki> a few
04:58 <jmalicki> not in TA specifically, studied applied math, CS, financial engineering
05:01 <jmalicki> sleepinn if you want to do fundamental analysis motley fool is a good resource
05:01 <jmalicki> to learn
05:01 <jmalicki> if you want to do TA and are comfortable with crypto i'd personally stick there
05:01 <jmalicki> it's way easier from what i can tell
05:01 <jmalicki> i've stayed focused on equities
05:02 <jmalicki> but in equities, fx, etc so many people have done the easy stuff, what opportunities remain are hard
05:02 <jmalicki> crypto seems waaay easier
05:03 <sleepinn> are you buying btc jmalicki
05:03 <jmalicki> sleepinn, no, too busy with iwth my equities stuff
05:03 <jmalicki> but swing trading btc seems like it should be extremely profitable
05:04 <jmalicki> if i get to a good stopping point where my time stops providing value in my equities strategy i plan on looking at it
05:04 <jmalicki> sleepinn cool
05:04 <jmalicki> sleepinn seems really easy to get into, i'd recommend getting better technically
05:04 <jmalicki> since eventually the smartest will pick off the easiest opportunities
05:05 <jmalicki> but it's a good place to learn, since the bar is low for now
05:05 <jmalicki> culture me? yes
05:34 <jmalicki> sleepinn yes, the bar is high
05:35 <jmalicki> sleepinn which is why greenfields like btc are better
05:35 <jmalicki> since you can get so much farther with less work
06:18 <notmike> jmalicki: do you get to shmang many models with the equities strategy?
06:19 <jmalicki> notmike i have no idea what shmang means
06:19 <notmike> jmalicki: https://youtu.be/xt5ghXdq6Z0
06:20 <jmalicki> oh you mean like fashion models
06:20 <jmalicki> well it works out
06:21 <jmalicki> but money is a crappy way to get girls
06:21 <jmalicki> real game is way better
06:22 <jmalicki> the only real way money matters to game is if you're going for like marriage and kids
06:23 <notmike> Wow, jmalicki gets it, holy shit
06:26 <jmalicki> yup
06:33 <jmalicki> notmike if you say hell no you may be turned into a beta paying child support
06:33 <jmalicki> if you're gonna do that you need to be at a level where lifelong child support is like whaetver like buying a cup of coffee
06:34 <jmalicki> chu is smart
06:36 <grzs> jmalicki: you seem to have issues
06:37 <jmalicki> grzs tots
19:51 <jmalicki> schools should have metal detectors to be sure everyone has a gun
19:51 <jmalicki> if it doesn't go off you'd be denied entry
19:53 <jmalicki> cryptotrash unless they start fighting in the street https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jahPCzoqrUg
19:55 <jmalicki> Wegg yeah, you have to watch out for the cassowaries
19:56 <jmalicki> cryptotrash roos are everywhere
19:57 <jmalicki> ibttis you have to watch out for the small cats too https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/worlds-deadliest-cat_us_5a5ece74e4b00a7f171b9893
19:58 <jmalicki> ibttis the orb spiders that eat birds are pretty terrifying too
19:59 <jmalicki> and they're like all over sydney, not just in the jungles
20:00 <jmalicki> https://imgur.com/gallery/j7VHBIT
20:00 <jmalicki> imagine that thing outside of your house
20:00 <jmalicki> cryptotrash just a normal suburban australian spider
20:02 <jmalicki> yeah visiting australia i probably saw a few dozen redbacks a day in Sydney
22:11 <jmalicki> python476 what does that mean?
22:12 <jmalicki> ah
22:12 <jmalicki> why gaussian?
22:13 <jmalicki> what is the advantage of that over 0 30 30 30 0 ?
22:13 <python476> jmalicki: I guess fested these numbers
22:14 <jmalicki> or 30 30 30 0 0 ?
22:15 <jmalicki> so then why wouldn't you go like 5 10 30 40 0 ?
22:15 <python476> jmalicki: stop teasing
22:16 <jmalicki> python476 just wondering what's special about gaussian
22:16 <jmalicki> i mean, you could just directly pile on proportional to the certainty
22:16 <python476> jmalicki: because I had the curve in mind and it sound pretentious
22:17 <jmalicki> python476 things like vwap are more common ways of "averaged entry"
22:18 <python476> thanks jmalicki
22:18 <jmalicki> python476 some brokers will even do it for you for a small fee e.g. https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4985
22:29 <jmalicki> what is pine?
22:29 <moriarty> jmalicki, it's a scripting language
22:30 <jmalicki> moriarty aren't there tools to trade directly from matlab?
22:31 <moriarty> jmalicki, indeed
22:31 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt matlab is *waaay* faster than python+numpy
22:31 <jmalicki> the matlab jit is fucking impressive
22:32 <jmalicki> yuriwho uh no
22:32 <jmalicki> yuriwho matlab dates to like the 1970s
22:32 <jmalicki> yuriwho i think matlab is even older than C
22:33 <jmalicki> yuriwho sorry i'm wrong, 1984 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB
22:33 <jmalicki> oh pre-commercial versions were in the 70s
22:34 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt the JIT came much later and helped a lot
22:35 <jmalicki> loool
22:37 <jmalicki> wait, is there a platform that runs these scripts?
22:37 <jmalicki> pine scripts?
22:37 <moriarty> jmalicki, tradingview
22:38 <jmalicki> is it software? the site seems to be a message board...
22:40 <jmalicki> i still *read* quite a bit of fortran code
22:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, it's a charting platform
22:40 <jmalicki> moriarty ah yeah, found it
22:41 <jmalicki> their website manages to obfuscate that fact quite well
22:42 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: jealous of whatever you do that has you reading fortran code :\
22:42 <moriarty> jmalicki, e.g. https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/
22:42 <moriarty> jmalicki, this is the interactive one https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSD
22:42 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt for peeking under the covers into BLAS, numpy etc
22:42 <jmalicki> moriarty++
22:43 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt probably 60% of numpy is fortran
22:43 <jmalicki> quite a bit is
22:43 <python476> jmalicki: so it's linked again fortran binaries not even c ?
22:43 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt numpy, scipy, sklearn all have tons of fortran
22:43 <jmalicki> python476 a mix of C and fortran
22:44 <jmalicki> plus higher-level python stuff
22:45 <jmalicki> huh NoImNotNineVolt huh maybe numpy is all C, scipy and sklearn def have lots of fortran
22:50 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: e.g. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/optimize/minpack
22:50 <jmalicki> you have to read the source for like "why is my LM optimizer giving me error 4?"
23:00 <jmalicki> oh wow i didn't realize lbfgs has been improved so recently https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/optimize/lbfgsb/lbfgsb.f
23:05 <python476> jmalicki: first time i see fortran code in lowercase
23:05 <jmalicki> python476 loool
23:08 <jmalicki> iz many have two versions
23:10 <jmalicki> iz no http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/files/live-cattle-delivery-manual-white-paper.pdf
23:10 <iz> jmalicki: haha nice find
23:13 <jmalicki> iz i can't find it on the internets now, but i remember of a good story about a trader who forgot to sell before settlement date and got stuck taking physical delivery
23:14 <iz> jmalicki: haha, i think i read a similar one.. with like.. physical barrels of oil
23:17 <jmalicki> also TIL if you're long cattle futures you get to decide whether you get live cattle or carcasses
23:19 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: ... you're taking delivery?
23:19 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: lol no, just read the manual on taking delivery of cattle
23:20 <jmalicki> lol "A delivery load must be comprised of all steers or all heifers. A mixed load is not deliverable."
23:25 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: same goes for wavelets, at least it has to follow a pattern to be meaningful
23:25 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: but like, that's the whole point...
23:26 <jmalicki> python476: they have, it's a whole field of math called "Functional Analysis"
23:26 <jmalicki> that's just an extension of fourier
23:27 <jmalicki> notmike it's a place where everyone chats about bitcoin prices
23:31 <jmalicki> jaggz "I'm not sure why they chose to do this, but they decided to initially use images of their own generated charts and convolutions on those images" loool reminds me of http://oneweirdkerneltrick.com/rank_slides.pdf
23:31 <jmalicki> jaggz where they make fun of CNN people who don't know any math doing that constantly
23:32 <jmalicki> loool
23:32 <jmalicki> moriarty++
23:32 <jmalicki> also, trading manually gives you good ideas about what you want to look for
23:33 <jaggz> jmalicki, lol.. all I know is really CNN.. my LSTM attempts have all failed.. but it just seems like a 1d conv would still be in a CNN person's mind for a y=f(x) function
23:35 <jmalicki> moriarty are you only refering to computational latency, or other issues as well?
23:35 <moriarty> jmalicki, yeah inner latency, also things like microstructure adds to that discrete nature
23:36 <jmalicki> jaggz usd/kor exchange rate ;P
23:36 <jmalicki> the real tricky part is when you backtest it and it works, but you fucked up your bbacktest ;P
23:37 <jmalicki> one needs to be very careful about backtest assumptions
23:41 <jmalicki> jaggz latency assumptions are also important
23:42 <jaggz> jmalicki, what's latency?
23:42 <jmalicki> jaggz time from your signal to trade
23:43 <jmalicki> jaggz like noone can look at one trade and immediately make the next trade
23:43 <jaggz> jmalicki, I was asking about that the other day, sort of.  I got the thought and question wrong.
23:43 <notmike> If you had a computer problem I would probably be more help than quantitative finance. moriarty and jmalicki got u covered there tho
23:44 <jmalicki> jaggz it takes time for the quotes to get to you, time for you to make your prediction, time to send the request to the exchange, if you have a limit order rather than market others may have priority, etc
23:45 <jaggz> jmalicki, yeah.. that's all an issue, and I'm inexperienced in it.
23:45 <jmalicki> jaggz to start with you can just be conservative
23:46 <jaggz> jmalicki, I figured I'd have to have my model work on larger longer-term fluctuations to help resolve that.
23:46 <jmalicki> jaggz it's very common for people to find predictability in financial prices at latencies lower than anyone can operate at ;P
23:46 <jmalicki> like of course you could predict it, because noone had the data yet
23:47 <jmalicki> jaggz like, if you use, say, Q4 GDP estimates to predict stock prices
23:47 <jmalicki> you have to use data that was *available that day*
23:48 <jmalicki> e.g. if you use corrected data that was released 3mos later from historical time series, well, noone had that data for the period you're trying to predict
23:48 <jmalicki> so the market was pricing based on different data than you're using in backtest
23:49 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: depends on assumptions about your taxes, and growth of investment
23:49 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: one nice thing about roth is it doesn't have required distributions
23:50 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: so one nice thing is if you assume you'll have roughly constant tax rates now and in retirement, roth allows you to basically make a bigger contribution
23:50 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: since the limits are the same
23:50 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: am i making sense?
23:51 <jmalicki> like an 18000 roth 401k contribution is like a 24000 normal 401k contribution
23:51 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: that's one part of it i'm surprised i haven't seen more ppl talk about
23:52 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: well, there is what *your* marginal rate is now vs average rate in the future, which is one thing
23:53 <jmalicki> noimnotninevolt even if tax rates go up across the board, on average you may still be lower
23:53 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yeah.. and also for retirement, you don't pay taxes on it at your marginal bracket, but *average* bracket, which is another factor
23:53 <jmalicki> i mean it's mitigating
20:02 <jmalicki> jazzanova options conversion?
20:02 <jmalicki> ah
20:03 <jmalicki> jazzanova you can sell european options
20:04 <jmalicki> jazzanova then you run the risk of early exercise
20:04 <jmalicki> jazzanova you could
20:05 <jmalicki> jazzanova but realistically, for a stock w/o dividends, early exercise is not rational for american calls, so i wouldn't worry that much about it?
20:05 <jmalicki> i mean it could happen
20:05 <jmalicki> but the person exercising early would be losing money by doing so
20:05 <jmalicki> vs selling the option
20:06 <jmalicki> jazzanova also, it means you've locked in the options premium if they do exercise early
20:06 <jmalicki> you can just unwind your position
20:07 <jmalicki> i mean horrible things can happen on the edges that prevent you from doing so in extreme market conditions
20:07 <jmalicki> bbut like, that's the risk you take
20:07 <jmalicki> jazzanova in short there is no fullproof protection... the profit from the conversion exists because some people don't want to take that risk
20:07 <jmalicki> lol there is no arbitrage
20:07 <jmalicki> there is only risk that some don
20:07 <jmalicki> t take into account
20:08 <jmalicki> jazzanova under *normal* market conditions, you're fine because you can always unwind the trade if someone does exercise early
20:08 <jmalicki> even though that's unlikely as early exercise of a *call* for a stock w/o dividends is irrational
20:09 <jmalicki> (though early exercise of a put can be quite rational, but you're buying a put so you don't have to worry)
20:09 <jmalicki> jazzanova: yeah, then it can be rational to exercise the call
20:09 <jmalicki> jazzanova: but then, you just unwind the trade
20:09 <jmalicki> and sell your put
20:10 <jmalicki> no
20:10 <jmalicki> because it's only worth it to exercise due to the dividend
20:10 <jmalicki> which means the stock price is expected to drop
20:11 <jmalicki> because the person exercising the call means that the dividend will be allocated before expiry
20:11 <jmalicki> and after that the price will drop
20:11 <jmalicki> ideally there is not a dividend that's allocated (allocated, not paid) just before expiry
20:12 <jazzanova> jmalicki: I want to collect the dividend
20:12 <jmalicki> jazzanova: not gonna happen
20:12 <jmalicki> i want a pony, too
20:13 <jmalicki> jazzanova: with an options conversion, you're only collecting the option premium, that's your only profit
20:13 <jmalicki> the difference in option premium between the call and put
20:13 <jmalicki> jazzanova: no, because then you'll get early exercise
20:14 <jmalicki> assuming your counterparty is rational
20:15 <jmalicki> most likely
20:15 <jmalicki> unless the dividend is smaller than the premium
20:16 <jmalicki> jazzanova: i mean, there are only a limited number of expiry dates
20:16 <jmalicki> so if you want an option you intend to execute just before the ex date
20:16 <jmalicki> it's likely you're gonna have to early exercise
20:17 <jmalicki> no
20:17 <jmalicki> stock prices move all the time for all kinds of reasons
20:17 <jmalicki> though it's likely to have a much bigger fall after the ex date
20:17 <jmalicki> jazzanova: you are basically sure that all else equal, the stock will fall by the amount of the dividend just after the ex date
20:17 <jmalicki> err
20:18 <jmalicki> the dividend allocation date
20:18 <jmalicki> yeah
20:18 <jmalicki> the dividend ex-date, not expiry date, it's confusing in context :)
20:19 <jmalicki> yeah, i just wanted to make sure we're talking about the same thing
20:20 <jmalicki> but it's not a *pure* arbitrage
20:20 <jmalicki> like there are crazy things that can happen to screw you
20:21 <jmalicki> jazzanova: once every few years markets get weird and everyone in "arbitrage" positions like these lose money
20:21 <jmalicki> yeah even then
20:22 <jmalicki> jazzanova: i'm talking weird things like the giant crash of August 6-9 2007
20:23 <jmalicki> jazzanova: it depends if it was rational to exercise
20:23 <jmalicki> jazzanova: if the counterparty had a *reason* to exercise, you'd be losing money
20:23 <jmalicki> if they didn't have a reason, you'd be making money
20:23 <jmalicki> assuming you also held the underlying
20:24 <jmalicki> that's why you buy the put in a conversion
20:25 <jmalicki> jazzanova: selling call options is called "picking up nickels in front of a steamroller" for a reason
20:25 <jmalicki> yeah, there's a lot of free nickels on the ground to pick up, free money, until...
20:27 <jmalicki> if there's money to be made, there is risk somewhere
20:49 <jazzanova> jmalicki: I'm still confused. The guy bought call options for me 3 days before the ex-dividend date. Let's say the extrinsic part he payed is $1. But, the dividend is $0.5. Why would he want to early exercise? Even if the stock price falls by dividend amount, he is still not making profit by exercising.
20:50 <jazzanova> jmalicki: Wouldn't have want to wait around until the price goes up (not fall) to cover that $1 he payed.
21:02 <jmalicki> jazzanova: so that guy can early exercise then buy the option again
21:03 <jmalicki> jazzanova: it's usually the best course of action under normal circumstances
21:04 <jmalicki> jazzanova: since after the price fall the option will decrease in value by it's Delta and theta
21:04 <jmalicki> You either have just the option, or the option plus dividend
21:05 <jmalicki> jazzanova: though if that is truly the case with your numbers, it may not make sense to exercise
21:05 <jmalicki> Since the market would be unlikely to let those numbers exist as in your scenario
21:23 <jazzanova> jmalicki: that makes sense, thanks.
23:27 <jmalicki> as2333 i'm a nihilist
23:27 <jmalicki> google sucks
23:28 <jmalicki> why should people ascribe to a political philosophy?
23:28 <as2333> jmalicki, yes, you already told me =) - And it looks like a good label for you
23:30 <jmalicki> samian it is hard
23:46 <jmalicki> samian what's wyckoff's method?
23:46 <jmalicki> https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/hiddenliquidity3.pdf
23:47 <jmalicki> Samian a lot of HFT firms use Hawkes Process models for this
23:48 <jmalicki> notmike Altera FPGAs
23:48 <jmalicki> write your own ethernet and routing logic in verilog
23:49 <jmalicki> no need for an OS or CPU
23:49 <jmalicki> plaerzen is that BC?
23:49 <plaerzen> jmalicki: alberta
23:49 <notmike> jmalicki: that's a joke, right?
23:50 <jmalicki> notmike there are some open source modules https://opencores.org/forum,Ethernet%20MAC
23:50 <ossifrage> jmalicki, most of the pain is in the packet processing not the packet movement
23:50 <jmalicki> ossifrage it's faster if you do it inline rather than store/forward
23:51 <jmalicki> less latency
23:54 <jmalicki> ossifrage oh wow, i assumed they were just store and forward
23:54 <ossifrage> jmalicki, that is one of the big problems for the open source router firmware, getting access to the magic cut-through stuff is a pain in the ass because of fucking broadcom
23:55 <ossifrage> notmike, jmalicki was kidding about the fpga thing
23:57 <ossifrage> jmalicki, it might not be true cut-through, it could still hit the per port fifos, but but they do some basic inspection/rewrite inline and then fault to the CPU packet queues
23:59 <jmalicki> ossifrage was not joking
23:59 <jmalicki> notmike a slightly more sane option is write your router directly on the network processor, e.g. the intel ixp etc
00:00 <jmalicki> notmike you can still get pretty fast
00:00 <jmalicki> notmike like lime trading uses ixp for their sponsored access margin management systems
00:01 <ossifrage> jmalicki, checkout the C3558, they put some interesting SOC networking stuff in that chip
00:01 <jmalicki> cool
00:01 <jmalicki> ossifrage++
00:05 <notmike> jmalicki: if you could help me put it into context maybe
00:06 <jmalicki> notmike you can usually get a board
00:06 <jmalicki> notmike like an FPGA board often comes with an ethernet phy etc.
00:08 <jmalicki> ossifrage it's much better to build a web-based admin console directly in your fpga
00:09 <jmalicki> boo, don't be weak and use the arm core
00:09 <ossifrage> jmalicki, it will still be some sort of programmable CPU
00:09 <jmalicki> ossifrage: why?
00:10 <jmalicki> ossifrage: just keep to the FPGA
00:10 <jmalicki> ossifrage: just get a bigger fpga
00:10 <jmalicki> you can definitely do a tcpip router in a moderately sized fpga
00:11 <jmalicki> ossifrage: TCPIP is not that complicated
00:17 <ossifrage> notmike, I still think jmalicki was kidding about the FPGA even though he denies it
00:17 <jmalicki> ossifrage https://opencores.org/project,tcp_socket
00:17 <jmalicki> ossifrage: that's an opensource webapp for an fpga
00:18 <notmike> jmalicki: could you link me to an example of this that's all put together perhaps, fam?
00:19 <jmalicki> notmike no, because noone seriously does this. you'd be a pioneer
00:19 <jmalicki> notmike like, noone outside of HFT firms
00:19 <jmalicki> because it's like 1000x more work
00:19 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I've done (indirectly) a pseudo-tcp stack in an FPGA for shoveling video around. Initially we wanted to just use ethernet but the other side fell on its face trying to consume the raw ethernet packets
00:19 <jmalicki> it's only worth it if those few nanoseconds make you lots of money
00:20 <notmike> jmalicki: https://youtu.be/rOSdmhHDTXo
00:21 <jmalicki> notmike https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/54e7/90e76e8c4b393f5e28df2a3d9f72392c27fe.pdf
00:41 <jmalicki> notmike you can probably get something fairly cheap on ebay
00:42 <jmalicki> wireless speeds have been getting so much faster, lots of people have probably upgraded if you're cool with only 300Mbps of wireless or so
00:49 <jmalicki> no pain, no gain
01:50 <jmalicki> ossifrage: what are you planning w/ 128GB?
01:51 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I can't tell you how many times I've OOMed my current box doing parallel compiles
01:51 <jmalicki> 128gb?!
01:51 <ossifrage> jmalicki, It was either 64GB or 128GB to fill up all the channels, I figured 128GB is moar better
01:52 <jmalicki> ah
01:52 <ossifrage> jmalicki, my current box has a sad 12GB
01:52 <jmalicki> oh yeah, that's tiny
01:54 <ossifrage> jmalicki, 128GB of ECC DDR4 is $1888, not that long ago it was <$1400
01:57 <jmalicki> ossifrage insane it's still that expensive... i got 128GB for $1350 in 2011
01:58 <jmalicki> (i mean it was ddr3, but i'd have expected a bigger price drop)
01:58 <ossifrage> jmalicki, the margins on memory suck and too many of the fabs switched over to flash
01:58 <jmalicki> ah
22:18 <jmalicki> jeffree: it fluctuates
22:19 <jmalicki> jeffree: it also depends on how cheap your electricity is
22:19 <jmalicki> also which currency... ASIC-resistant currencies are better for mining
22:20 <jmalicki> oh, when I quit i was paying 11 cents per kw/h and it was too much
22:20 <jmalicki> but it depends on the recent price of bitcoin vs. how much miners have invested to keep up with it
22:21 <jmalicki> https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-one-chart-heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-bitcoin-in-your-state-2017-12-15
22:21 <jmalicki> ah
22:21 <jmalicki> they didn't exist at the time
22:23 <jmalicki> if you have the GPU already it may be worth it
22:23 <jmalicki> like leave it on at night or when you go to work
22:23 <jmalicki> plaerzen: at these prices even an older gpu might be ok
22:24 <jmalicki> if you already own the gpu it's a sunk cost
22:24 <jmalicki> you only have to worry about the marginal cost of electricity
22:25 <jmalicki> or just grab a bunch of ASICs from an unguarded datacenter in iceland ;P
23:34 <jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: if you're a normie
23:34 <jmalicki> cool people use bitfinex
23:35 <solidfox> jmalicki: if bitfinex is the more popular option, wouldn't it be "normie" to use it, not gdax?
23:35 <jmalicki> solidfox: GDAX has more volume
23:36 <jmalicki> Kraken has the most, if your request doesn't time out
23:38 <jmalicki> ah thanks i was looking at a different time window
23:39 <jmalicki> it does matter, you don't want to be called a name
23:39 <jmalicki> if you want to virtue signal that you're a true bitcoin believer you shouldn't trade on an exchange that cooperates with the IRS
23:47 <jmalicki> solidfox: are you going to go all in on fiat now?
23:48 <solidfox> jmalicki: nah I'm all in on junk food though
23:55 <jmalicki> jeffree that's incorrect
23:55 <jmalicki> jeffree you can deduct losses up to your gains + $3000
23:56 <jmalicki> gains *in that year*
23:56 <jmalicki> if you make $10k in 2017, and lose $10k in 2018, that's where you can only deduct $3000/yr and carry over the rest
23:56 <jmalicki> but if you then make $10k in 2019, you can deduct the remaining $7k in 2019
00:04 <jmalicki> as2333 why?
00:04 <jmalicki> as2333 if everyone is free to do whatever they want, shouldn't they be free to form a government that collectively owns the means of production?
00:05 <jmalicki> as2333 do you want to be a tyrant and deny people the freedom to make that transaction?
00:05 <as2333> jmalicki, government is by definition coercive
00:05 <jmalicki> actually, no, that's not part of the definition
00:06 <as2333> jmalicki, and anyway NoImNotNineVolt is just an american fascist who claims to have worked for the military, so....
00:06 <jmalicki> as2333 shouldn't people who like bondage have the freedom to be coerced?
00:07 <as2333> jmalicki, if you choose to do bondage then you are not being coerced.
00:07 <jmalicki> as2333 so if i choose socialism i'm not being coerced?
00:07 <as2333> jmalicki, no
00:07 <jmalicki> exactly!
00:07 <as2333> jmalicki, bu that's different than a socialist government
00:08 <as2333> jmalicki, so spare me the cheap language twisting? =)
00:08 <jmalicki> as2333 governments are just organizations collectively formed by individuals
00:08 <as2333> jmalicki, I don't object to voluntary socialism in theory
00:08 <as2333> jmalicki, government are criminal organizations
00:09 <as2333> jmalicki,also "socialist-libertarian" would be some sort of libertarian. And NoImNotNineVolt is anything but libertarain.
00:09 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: also north korea
00:09 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: i don't think north korea meets the 'voluntary' criteria we were talking about :P
00:10 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: everyone adores their leader!
00:34 <jeffree> jmalicki: you are sure about that? If in 2017 you make 10k and lose 10k, so you break even, you owe no tax?
23:02 <jmalicki> marginal_: do rental yields for like baltimore include vacancies?
23:02 <marginal_> i have no clue jmalicki
23:02 <jmalicki> a lot of the high ones are ones with lots of empty homes etc
23:03 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: or you go to a broker and get lots of quotes
23:03 <jmalicki> auctions bring low prices
01:34 <jmalicki> but the more transaction speed increases, that is some money that need not exist
01:34 <jmalicki> as2333 it's a different driver of demand
01:35 <jmalicki> notmike: you might say that the easier it is to do transactions, the more transactions will go up
01:35 <jmalicki> notmike: so if transactions get 2x as fast and people do 4x as many transactions, that would double demand
01:35 <as2333> jmalicki, wrong
01:36 <jmalicki> as2333 well you need *some* theory as to how speeding up transactions increases demand for bitcoin
01:36 <as2333> jmalicki, I agree that it can lower it somewhat like you say.
01:37 <jmalicki> notmike: all else equal it decreases
01:37 <jmalicki> notmike: if the system is closed
01:37 <jmalicki> notmike: but maybe then btc looks more attractive, and more people enter the system
01:37 <jmalicki> notmike: so for it to go up, it has to cause more people to use bitcoin more than the speedup
01:38 <jmalicki> which could be plausible
01:38 <jmalicki> notmike: yeah but that's the second order effect
01:38 <jmalicki> the first-order effect of faster transactions is to drop the price
01:39 <jmalicki> if the second order effect is larger than the first order, it goes up
01:39 <notmike> jmalicki: you a bear my dude 🐻
01:39 <jmalicki> notmike: it just makes sense to think about all of the forces acting on it
01:39 <jmalicki> notmike: the price goes up when the bull forces are stronger than the bear forces
01:40 <notmike> jmalicki: let's get this money
01:40 <jmalicki> and any change can cause both bull and bear forces
01:40 <jmalicki> it's a question of which one is stronger
01:40 <as2333> jmalicki, bitcoin is deflationary
01:41 <jmalicki> notmike: i'm guessing it's probably easy to find out what fraction of bitcoin is waiting to be transacted at a time?
01:41 <jmalicki> as2333 well, there are some deflationary forces.
01:41 <jmalicki> bbut it's a very complex system
01:42 <notmike> jmalicki: we'll never know how much coin has been lost
01:43 <jmalicki> bhaak for instance there is the price of gpus and asics
01:43 <jmalicki> bhaak: if they drop really fast, maybe it becomes inflationary
01:44 <jmalicki> i mean bitcoin is deflationary, right? once it hit 18000 usd/btc, it can never drop below that right?
01:44 <jmalicki> it's literally impossibble
01:45 <jmalicki> if that were possible, your theory of how bitcoin works may need to accomodate those facts
01:45 <jmalicki> as2333 i have created bitcoins at will all the time
01:45 <jmalicki> with my gpus
01:47 <jmalicki> it's not the govt printing money, it's me printing money
01:47 <jmalicki> i go to newegg.com and order a money printing machine, assemble it, start printing
01:47 <as2333> jmalicki, what do you think you achieve by saying that sort of thing?
01:47 <as2333> jmalicki, you are obviously ignoring a basic point on purpose
01:48 <jmalicki> as2333 no i mean i've printed bitcoin as a side gig
01:49 <as2333> jmalicki, but not 'at will'
01:49 <jmalicki> as2333 right, it was an addiction, i couldn't stop
01:49 <jmalicki> it was against my will, under duress
01:50 <jmalicki> as2333 the same way a business owner makes money at will... you buy equipment open up shop and start selling things, by your will
01:51 <as2333> jmalicki, you have to pay to open up a shop
01:51 <as2333> jmalicki, you can't produce the capital needed to open a shop 'at will'.
01:51 <jmalicki> as2333 still have to have the will to do so
01:51 <as2333> jmalicki, but if you are the govt you can steal it at will thru inflation
01:51 <as2333> jmalicki, but with bitcoin you can't do that.
01:52 <jmalicki> as2333 the govt still has to have computers for their databases, and banks to sign up with accounts at the fed, etc
01:52 <jmalicki> it's work
01:52 <jmalicki> as2333 they have to pay their employees to say "UPDATE money = money *2"
01:52 <as2333> jmalicki, and those costs are like 0.0000001% of the money they counterfeit.
01:53 <jmalicki> as2333 oh, so if i'm profitable it's pure will, and no work  involved?
01:54 <jmalicki> sounds right to me
01:54 <jmalicki> i think that's bayes theorem
02:08 <jmalicki> bhaak: are you sure?
02:08 <jmalicki> bhaak: she did describe herself as a male chauvanist
02:08 <bhaak> jmalicki: the misogynistic reply to that would probably be that although she recognized that being a woman is bad, that didn't allow her to put herself at the same level as a man.
19:31 <jmalicki> there are factories in existence today that can still press a million CDs?
19:32 <jmalicki> if you had said 20 years ago i'd be like sure :)
19:33 <jmalicki> there were $4.7 billion in dvd sales last year
19:33 <jmalicki> so that means it's plausible that total number of optical disks pressed are *slightly* above 1 million/day
19:33 <jmalicki> currently
19:34 <jmalicki> in the whole world
19:34 <jmalicki> i think that's just dvds
19:34 <jmalicki> and bluray
19:35 <jmalicki> 169 total alnums in all formats for audio https://www.statista.com/statistics/273308/music-album-sales-in-the-us/
19:35 <jmalicki> 169M
19:35 <jmalicki> all physical formats
19:35 <jmalicki> oh wait no, that number includes digital
19:36 <jmalicki> i don't think so
19:36 <jmalicki> it sounds like it's roughly half digital half CD plus some vinyl and other stuff https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7430863/2016-soundscan-nielsen-music-mid-year-album-sales-sink-streaming-growth
19:36 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: 50 million compact disks in 2016 in us alone
19:37 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i mean people still use AOL
19:37 <GenteelBen> jmalicki, remember those AOL CDs?
19:37 <jmalicki> yes
19:38 <jmalicki> they were good for microwaving
19:38 <jmalicki> GenteelBen: plus the one per week you'd get in the mail
19:38 <jmalicki> GenteelBen: some of their grandparents still use aol
19:38 <jmalicki> over cable modem
19:39 <jmalicki> don't forget rural areas where modems are all you have
19:39 <jmalicki> or you can do satellite download modem upload
19:43 <jmalicki> yeah they used to sell a lot
19:43 <jmalicki> it's come way down
19:43 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: on average, before 2007
19:44 <jmalicki> well maybe not peak, that goes back to 1982 pre-peak
19:44 <jmalicki> under $50mn/day peak
19:44 <jmalicki> err 50m/day
19:45 <jmalicki> now those factories have probably been repurposed for technology that's more relevant in the modern world than it was in 2007, like vinyl LPs
00:19 <notmike> You have to be careful around mathematicians like jmalicki. Inoculated with the flawed ideas of the good Rev Bayes one begins to imagine mathematical forms as real things, descriptive of the 'real world'
00:20 <jmalicki> wut
00:21 <jmalicki> of course the model is wrong
00:21 <jmalicki> meh, it's useful
00:30 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: how far into math education did you go?
00:31 <latentprion> jmalicki: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
05:18 <jmalicki> productive day: unsubscribed from about 200 spam email lists
05:18 <jmalicki> there are just SOOO many these days
05:18 <jmalicki> fuck growth hacking
05:21 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: it's like a link aggregator
05:22 <jmalicki> oh paulgraham.com
05:22 <jmalicki> that is a blog
05:22 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: ##econometrics if you listen to the claims?
05:23 <jmalicki> here everyone is a lamboless decamillionaire if not more ;P
05:23 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: I mean mark zuckerberg  drives a VW GTI
05:24 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: jeff bezos drove a toyota camry for years after he was a billionaire
05:24 <jmalicki> (zuckerberg probably got rid of the the GTI *by now*, but he did for a long time)
05:25 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: Steve Jobs didn't have a lambo, he just bought a new mercedes every month so he never had to get permanent plates
05:25 <jmalicki> imagine walking into the dealer with that request
05:26 <jmalicki> "i'd like to special order this car, with a new one arriving every month"
05:28 <jmalicki> lol as if you could
05:28 <jmalicki> i'd be shorting uber long ago if that were possible
05:44 <jmalicki> i saw from another source
05:45 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: yeah, people tend to be careful about their cars since they're seen in public with their cars
05:46 <jmalicki> often "being noticed as being rich" is much more of a harm than a help
05:46 <jmalicki> so people drive something nice but not unusual
05:46 <jmalicki> e.g. if you drive an expensive car to work, other employees wonder about what you're making and that creates resentment, etc
05:47 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: apparently some douchebags do
05:47 <jmalicki> lol not if you have a lambo :)
05:47 <jmalicki> that would be like missing the entire fucking point :)
05:48 <jmalicki> a security guard at pinterest i know said he's seen some people drive ferarris to work
05:49 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi++
05:49 <jmalicki> as2333 well that's how the IRS gets you
05:50 <jmalicki> and if noone else gets you the irs will
05:50 <jmalicki> it's how they got al capone, for instance
05:50 <jmalicki> he bought too much nice stuff
05:50 <jmalicki> that he didn't pay taxes on income to afford
05:50 <jmalicki> as2333: they are always on the lookout for people who own nice stuff
05:51 <jmalicki> and they have informants for that
05:51 <jmalicki> jealous your neighbor got a nice car? call them and get a reward
05:51 <jmalicki> they rely on your neighbors and friends to do it for you
05:52 <notmike> jmalicki: u know about rims?
05:52 <jmalicki> as2333 it still happens a lot http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12295860/irs-paid-61-million-to-whistleblowers-in-2016
05:52 <jmalicki> notmike only the spinning ones
05:52 <as2333> jmalicki, that's money laundering =)
05:52 <jmalicki> no, it's "the tax whistleblower program"
05:52 <jmalicki> notmike on like car wheel rims?
05:53 <jmalicki> notmike oh i've only gotten sizes recommended by tirerack
05:53 <as2333> jmalicki, no. that's money the IRS launders.
05:53 <jmalicki> as2333 ?
05:54 <as2333> jmalicki, moeny they pay to themselves
05:54 <jmalicki> as2333 https://www.irs.gov/compliance/whistleblower-informant-award
05:55 <jmalicki> as2333 if the irs gets taxes owed from someone that didn't pay based on your tip, you get a cut
05:55 <jmalicki> as a fraction of all taxes it's small
05:55 <as2333> jmalicki, right - so called whistleblowers get a cut - so they are govt agents in pracitce
05:55 <jmalicki> as2333 no no, it can be anyone
05:56 <jmalicki> well i guess in practice sure
05:56 <jmalicki> " is mandated to help whistleblowers has a backlog of 29,835 open cases, and a staff of only 37 employees." lol
05:56 <jmalicki> well, i guess if you don't owe millions they don't even bother
05:57 <jmalicki> as2333 sure... that's why they make you report on who you paid, and who you were paid by
05:57 <jmalicki> so any time there's not a match they can go audit the one who didn't report
05:57 <jmalicki> like if i report my taxes from what you paid me, and you didn't report, they can audit you and find all the people you paid
05:57 <jmalicki> etc
05:57 <jmalicki> they make everyone into an informant on everyone else
05:57 <jmalicki> highly efficient
05:58 <jmalicki> OPK light cheap rims are nice, less weight!
05:58 <jmalicki> though they can help cornering if they're heavy...
05:58 <jmalicki> iateadonut: i am
05:58 <iateadonut> jmalicki, what is your business?
05:58 <jmalicki> iateadonut: something something sas something
05:59 <jmalicki> iateadonut: high frequency trading
05:59 <iz> jmalicki: ah yes.. SSSaaSS
06:01 <jmalicki> notmike my ex has DW Contact for all seasons, they're decent
06:01  * jmalicki prefers Michelin Pilot Supersport
06:02 <jmalicki> i like how it only has one wheel that spins
06:02 <jmalicki> oh sweet
06:03 <jmalicki> is that an amg?
06:03 <jmalicki> ah nice
06:04 <jmalicki> ah  OPK++
06:04 <jmalicki> OPK yeah the side of the logo on the front grill threw me off, no way i'd place a holden ;P
06:04 <jmalicki> lol continental see conversation :)
06:05 <jmalicki> OPK those are your race tires?
06:06 <OPK> jmalicki road race yeh
06:06 <jmalicki> cool
06:09 <jmalicki> i wear ferraris on the bus

06:09 <jmalicki> ugh sorry
06:15 <jmalicki> notmike would you have ever sold at 17k, or waited until 9k
06:15 <jmalicki> notmike: i mean don't kick yourself unless it was a legitimate counterfactual
06:16 <notmike> jmalicki: I can neither confirm nor deny any selling around 17k. I also may have bought back some.
06:16 <jmalicki> notmike: "selling at the top" is not a legitimate counterfactual unless you actually predicted the top ahead of time
06:17 <jmalicki> yeah, but you can only kick yourself for decisions you could have realistically made
06:17 <jmalicki> notmike: that's called diversification
06:17 <jmalicki> some up, some down, up overall
06:18 <notmike> jmalicki: I think everyone knew 18-20k was a little ridiculous. I knew. I just thought markets could stay irrational longer than I could stay solvent
06:18 <jmalicki> notmike: yeah, but a lot of people "knew" $10k was ridiculous too
06:23 <jmalicki> OPK The Mueller special prosecutors office
06:26 <jmalicki> OPK sometimes they throw you a bone to avoid the cost of a trial
06:26 <jmalicki> OPK like "it will cost the state $20k if you make us go through a trial, so if you plea we'll give you less time"
06:27 <jmalicki> OPK even if the case is rock solid
06:27 <jmalicki> OPK plea-ing guilty is way better if you know you're gonna lose
06:27 <jmalicki> in expectation you're better off usually
06:28 <jmalicki> like sure maybe there's one crazy juror who would let you go
06:28 <jmalicki> but like
06:28 <jmalicki> if the evidence is very solid, you usually get a deal to plea
06:28 <jmalicki> since they don't have to bother with a trial
06:29 <jmalicki> iateadonut: the district attorney got the guy off?
06:29 <iateadonut> jmalicki, got me off.  void for vagueness.
06:30 <jmalicki> OPK yeah but also if you fuck that up, you're better off pleaing
06:30 <jmalicki> OPK once you fuck that up, no point in the trial
06:30 <jmalicki> OPK and sometimes even if you don't sometimes the evidence is solid
06:31 <jmalicki> OPK shit like a dui where people get their blood drawn... you can't defend that shit unless you have a legit probably cause issue
06:31 <OPK> jmalicki
06:32 <jmalicki> cop saw you driving, drew blood over the limit, you're done
06:32 <jmalicki> plead
06:32 <jmalicki> unless they had no reason to stop
06:32 <jmalicki> OPK that is probably like 50% of the cases the criminal justice system sees :)
06:32 <jmalicki> that specific situation :)
06:33 <jmalicki> yeah that's also stupid
06:33 <jmalicki> OPK just sometimes, you know they have you, plea, no point in pretending the jury will be fine
06:33 <jmalicki> yep
06:33 <jmalicki> but if the lawyer says they've got you
06:33 <jmalicki> you know you have to plea
06:34 <jmalicki> if a good lawyer says that
06:35 <jmalicki> i did go for a jury trial once though
06:35 <jmalicki> it was a solid prostitution case
06:35 <jmalicki> the DA scheduled it for when the cops were on vacation, had to dismiss
06:35 <OPK> jmalicki lmfao
06:35 <iateadonut> jmalicki, did you let her go?
06:35 <jmalicki> but that's like a one in a million shot
06:36 <jmalicki> the public defender said she'd never even heard of that happening before
06:36 <jmalicki> iateadonut: with a citation  that's one thing, a jury trial is quite another
06:36 <jmalicki> the DA really fucked that up apparently
06:36 <jmalicki> iateadonut: that's part of voir dire
06:37 <jmalicki> iateadonut: they ask you that
06:37 <jmalicki> iateadonut: if you say they'd let you go, you can't be on the jury, if you let them go, and they suspect you lied, you might get perjury
06:37 <as2333> jmalicki, and if you say you'll do the right thing, you go to jail I supposed?
06:37 <jmalicki> as2333 no, they just dismiss you from the jury
06:37 <jmalicki> and you go home and don't have to hear the case
06:38 <jmalicki> i think you have a slightly elevated chance of getting called again vs. being on the jury if that happens
06:38 <jmalicki> iateadonut: i think they call you more often in that case
06:38 <jmalicki> like "we're gonna find a jury you're ok with being on"
06:39 <jmalicki> at least in CA
06:40 <jmalicki> iateadonut: lol did you see the shkreli voir dire?  "He disrepected WuTang"
06:40 <jmalicki> https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/public-enemy/
06:40 <jmalicki> "juror no. 52: When I walked in here today I looked at him, and in my head, that’s a snake — not knowing who he was. I just walked in and looked right at him and that’s a snake."
06:40 <jmalicki> "juror no. 59: And he disrespected the Wu-Tang Clan."
06:41 <jmalicki> amazing voir dire
06:42 <jmalicki> iateadonut: he bought their album with one copy and wouldn't let anyone else hear it
06:43 <jmalicki> a little bit of both probably
06:44 <jmalicki> in my prostitution case, the jurors were all like "prostitution shouldn't be a crime , i shall be heard, they are victims!!" and the judge was like, fine, but the law says it is a crime, could you rule guilty if the evidence said so? and most were like yeah... like thanks for being on your soapbox and wasting my time
06:45 <iateadonut> jmalicki, hmmm...
06:47 <jmalicki> iateadonut: that wasn't presented,  very little evidence was presented before jury selection
06:47 <jmalicki> they only read a paragraph of the charges
06:50 <jmalicki> as2333 not somalia, they're a libertarian paradise
06:51 <jmalicki> iateadonut: wait which areas in east asia and europe have had peace and prosperity for 70 years?
06:51 <jmalicki> iateadonut: i mean switzerland sure
06:52 <jmalicki> iateadonut: north korea has been prosperous for 70 years???
06:52 <jmalicki> iateadonut: even south korea has not been *prosperous* for 70 years or taiwan
06:52 <jmalicki> it took them awhile to work up to that
06:52 <jmalicki> or even japan
06:53 <iateadonut> jmalicki, the US is not occupying north korea.
06:53 <jmalicki> depends where you draw the boundary, but in the 50s all of them were pretty poor
06:54 <jmalicki> japan really pulled out in the late 60s, taiwan and south korea took a bit longer
06:57 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: it would have fewer dictators
06:57 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: ISIS wouldn't exist
06:58 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: we'd be part of a democracy without scandals like Russia ;P
06:59 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: no way, we would have fewer churrascarias
07:00 <jmalicki> louipc yeah that's what all the fascist sympathizers say
07:00 <jmalicki> louipc i'm right wing, i can't be fascist... oh wait. but i support government interference in the economy because that's what my right wing candidate does...
07:01 <louipc> jmalicki: big government is left wing u commie
07:01 <jmalicki> louipc tell that to Trump
07:01 <jmalicki> louipc ICE, Border Patrol, tariffs? yeah that's all leftwing
07:02 <jmalicki> louipc so trump is more liberal than hillary?
07:03 <louipc> jmalicki: they are not more or less. they are the same
07:05 <jmalicki> louipc as long as you realize that.. i've heard "republicans can't be fascist because they're the right" a number of times in the past 18 months
07:07 <louipc> jmalicki: depends if they're really right, or neocon 'right'. thats what makes politics so confusing. wouldnt you call antifa tactics fascist? but then people make all kind of new conflicting definitions
07:08 <jmalicki> louipc antifa tactics aren't fascist, because fascism is about an economy controlled by large corporations
07:08 <jmalicki> fascism *means something*
07:08 <louipc> jmalicki: oh lol is that what fascism is ok
07:09 <jmalicki> louipc it's not ok, just antifa are a different kind of bad than fascist
07:09 <jmalicki> louipc they're anarcho-communist usually
07:09 <jmalicki> xissburg often, but it does have actual meaning
07:09 <jmalicki> which is *also bad*
07:09 <jmalicki> but different
07:10 <jmalicki> *not fascist* doesn't mean good
07:10 <jmalicki> it just means not bad in that particular way
07:10 <jmalicki> "Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies."
07:10 <yuriwho> jmalicki: it seems you are young: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts
07:11 <jmalicki> xissburg they are different, if you lump them together you cannot effectively fight them
07:11 <jmalicki> since different things defeat each
07:11 <jmalicki> xissburg: yes and no
07:11 <jmalicki> xissburg: there are some similarities, other disagreements
07:12 <jmalicki> xissburg: in different ways.. if you generalize that much you've lost the argument with any of them
07:12 <jmalicki> even if it's true
07:13 <jmalicki> xissburg: no!  fascists are not collectivist!
07:13 <jmalicki> xissburg: fascists are about state control!
07:13 <jmalicki> xissburg: where the collective does not control the state, oligopolists do!
07:13 <xissburg> jmalicki by that I mean the individual is just a cog
07:13 <as2333> jmalicki, yes they are collectivist. They are nationalist.
07:13 <jmalicki> xissburg: fascists are about something much closer to feudalism
07:13 <jmalicki> as2333 fascists don't think the collective has a share of the nation
07:14 <jmalicki> xissburg: in collectivism the individual isn't just a cog
07:14 <as2333> jmalicki, the nation is a collectivistic concept.
07:14 <jmalicki> xissburg: in collectivism the individual is an owner of a bankrupt enterprise
20:13 <jmalicki> awesome, the NSA created their own bitcoin mixing service that sent the data directly to the NSA
20:13 <jmalicki> so you could be anonymous to everyone except the nsa!
20:14 <jmalicki> ya
20:14 <jmalicki> brilliant
20:23 <jmalicki> wuzarine PM steal yo girl?
20:24 <jmalicki> GenteelBen: still not nearly as violent as christians
20:29 <jmalicki> some people take it well http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4779786/Woman-one-arm-goes-viral-Tinder.html
20:29 <Varunram> jmalicki: arms dealer hehe
20:31 <GenteelBen> jmalicki: that one-armed chick is hot.
20:37 <jmalicki> wuzamarine it also means you like to watch
20:37 <GenteelBen> lol jmalicki
21:00 <jmalicki> dorei yes
21:01 <jmalicki> dorei like these cheap used watches https://worldofluxuryus.com/pre-owned-watches/patek-philippe.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw4sLVBRAlEiwASblR-5cyQy-ylpgIMSRATC7pWQLCohkt1O6OCT6tV4Edo0k9PWHRwQwFiBoCqPMQAvD_BwE
21:01 <jmalicki> hot sale, *only* $201k
21:03 <jmalicki> GenteelBen: who is us?
21:03 <GenteelBen> jmalicki: upper-classmen.
21:05 <Brie_> jmalicki: Oh what what rig stuff you get that much of dollars :)
21:05 <jmalicki> Brie_ oh that's for a watch not a rig
21:06 <jmalicki> goodblood: omg CA has *horrible* roads if it ever freezes, since they're just completely perplexed by potholes
21:06 <jmalicki> goodblood: like they completely lack the ability to repair potholes
21:06 <jmalicki> goodblood: not often, but maybe a week every two years
21:07 <jmalicki> and the highways are fucked for like six months
21:08 <jmalicki> ossifrage: he's from california where it doesn't rain
21:11 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I've driven in pretty much whiteout conditions where it was only dumb luck I didn't drive off the road
21:11 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I'm not sure if any sensor system other then gpus and a prayer would work in those conditions
21:16 <jmalicki> ossifrage radar http://www.autonews.com/article/20160210/OEM06/160219995/self-driving-cars-succumb-to-snow-blindness-as-driving-lanes-disappear
21:16 <jmalicki> _Sam-- most industries have seen job increases due to automation
21:16 <plaerzen> jmalicki: so like... what happens 8 months per year up here?
21:16 <jmalicki> plaerzen if by "up here" you mean the arctic part of sweden, then yes
21:17 <plaerzen> jmalicki: canada
21:17 <jmalicki> plaerzen: no, canada has way less snow
21:17 <jmalicki> they're testing in rough conditions
21:17 <plaerzen> jmalicki: it's march, and I would challenge you to find the road lines in 50% of my city.
21:17 <jmalicki> plaerzen: yeah, they're testing in way tougher conditions
21:18 <plaerzen> jmalicki: like what?
21:18 <ossifrage> jmalicki, the vision system fails, the lidar and radar just scatters, GPS error goes up... I think meat just relies on luck and trust of the idiot in front of them
21:18 <jmalicki> ossifrage: radar scatters way less
21:18 <jmalicki> ossifrage: it means you have a few extra inches of visibility
21:20 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I'm not sure how useful the radar is for terrain, I thought it was mostly used for detecting largish things in the way and relative speeds
23:01 <jmalicki> as2333 actually no, that's pretty much how communism starts too
23:05 <as2333> jmalicki, and basciall the same thing happens under communism - that should tell you something about the nature of your free world.
23:06 <jmalicki> ossifrage: what aspect of it?
23:07 <ossifrage> jmalicki, when funding expires fetching new funding is batched (which is really needed or the funding would get chopped into ever smaller pieces) but they seem to game when they run the funding batch
23:07 <jmalicki> ossifrage they don't leave it to the market?
23:08 <ossifrage> jmalicki, the problem is I think they are a major source of funding
23:09 <jmalicki> ossifrage if you think you can beat it, you can do the funding!
23:09 <ossifrage> jmalicki, yeah I do, manually, which is why I have spent too much time watching the funding engine run
23:17 <jmalicki> ossifrage: the immaturity of crypto markets is teaching you some lessons about trading ;P
23:17 <jmalicki> ossifrage: this is how i lost a lot of money in 2008 shorting lehman brothers
23:18 <ossifrage> jmalicki, well I managed to loose a shitload of btc margin trading, so there is that... But I also managed to invest in interesting tech companies that went bankrupt
23:18 <jmalicki> ossifrage: but funding can come and go, if your position depends on it you're fucked
23:19 <jmalicki> ossifrage: especially if you're large enough to be worth manipulating
23:19 <ossifrage> jmalicki, yeah I've avoided making certain trades because of the lack of liquidity in the bfx funding market
23:20 <jmalicki> nice, a YC funded private prison
23:22 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I hate that I live in a country where private prisons are a thing
23:22 <jmalicki> ossifrage: you'd rather the govt provided them?
23:23 <ossifrage> jmalicki, I don't want prisons to be a profit center
23:23 <jmalicki> ossifrage: like this, where a sheriff can spend money allotted towards feeding prisoners to buy himself a house? https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/14/593204274/alabama-sheriff-legally-took-750-000-meant-to-feed-inmates-bought-beach-house
23:23 <jmalicki> ossifrage: it already is!
23:23 <ossifrage> jmalicki, yeah but it is alabama
23:23 <jmalicki> ossifrage: it's also legal there!
23:23 <jmalicki> if the sheriff doesn't spend the tax money on prisoners he legally gets to keep it!!
23:24 <ossifrage> jmalicki, did you read what that fucker sheriff did to is landscaper over that report? Got the poor guy arrested by some magic drug charges
23:25 <jmalicki> of course
23:35 <jmalicki> louipc: sort of like the people's liberation army prisons
23:36 <jmalicki> they definitely have profit motive
05:51 <jmalicki> latentprion: killer bee stings aren't painful, you just die
05:51 <jmalicki> before you can feel pain
05:52 <db> jmalicki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee#Misconceptions
05:52 <jmalicki> db you and your dumb facts should stay out of the argument
05:52 <jmalicki> it's about drama, not facts
05:53 <jmalicki> after all, this channel is into cryptocurrency
05:53 <jmalicki> no point in facts
05:59 <latentprion> jmalicki: That sounds pretty painful to me
06:38 <jmalicki> ashtar wtf are you on about
06:38 <jmalicki> ashtar go to theranos' investors
23:48 <jazzanova> jmalicki: hi, I thought about what you told me last time, regarding early exercise of option, because of dividend coming up. However, I am not sure if it is bad for me. Remember, I was doing a conversion, so when that happens, why won't I just sell the PUT, making huge profit, much more than the dividend.
19:04 <jmalicki> _Sam-- interest rates would go up quite a bit
19:04 <jmalicki> yeah they could print more dollars
19:07 <jmalicki> _Sam-- us residents can buy as many treasury bonds as they want
19:07 <jmalicki> why focus on savings bonds?
19:08 <jmalicki> _Sam-- just don't buy savings bonds
19:09 <jmalicki> _Sam-- if you want more than $10k you can deal with the complexity of treasuries
19:09 <jmalicki> _Sam-- because treasury bond usually refers to a separate instrument
19:10 <jmalicki> _Sam-- you can purchase up to $5million in each auction (which usually multiple times per week) w/o having to participate in an auction.. if you want to participate in the auction you can do more https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm
19:10 <jmalicki> _Sam-- any citizen is allowed to buy them, just sign up for treasury direct, or ask your bank
19:11 <jmalicki> _Sam-- you have to sign up for treasury direct anyway to get a series ee savings bond
19:12 <jmalicki> _Sam-- you can just go to the bank and leave with a treasury
19:12 <jmalicki> it is no more complicated
19:13 <jmalicki> _Sam-- it's just an old legacy contract that the treasury wants to phase out but people got fixated on them
19:13 <jmalicki> _Sam-- the only big difference is savings bonds can be in increments of $0.01 vs $100 for treasuries
19:13 <jmalicki> _Sam-- there is an update... treasury bonds
19:14 <jmalicki> the only reason savings bonds still exist is some people are irrationally attached for them
19:14 <jmalicki> _Sam-- if you only have $20 the limit doesn't matter
19:14 <jmalicki> if you have $10k, treasury bonds serve you fine
19:18 <jmalicki> _Sam-- they want to discourage it with limits because they're bad for the investor
19:18 <jmalicki> _Sam-- they pay lower rates than treasuries
19:18 <jmalicki> so they're really just a way for the government to take advantage of old people who are scared of treasuries
19:19 <jmalicki> but *anyone* can buy treasury bonds without limit
19:19 <jmalicki> if you don't want to buy them from treasurydirect you can buy them in the open market
19:28 <jmalicki> _Sam-- so you want high interest rates?
19:29 <jmalicki> when MPs get in, you know it's time to sell ;P
19:29 <jmalicki> taxi drivers are one thing, MPs quite another
20:19 <jmalicki> moriarty: how do you decide what the fair price is?
20:19 <jmalicki> marginal_ 6trill vs. 2b what?
20:20 <moriarty> jmalicki, a simple gold/silver price ratio per oz i imagine
20:20 <moriarty> jmalicki, then i'd look at it over different time windows
20:20 <jmalicki> moriarty++
20:20 <jmalicki> marginal_: 2 trillion what?
20:20 <jmalicki> marginal_++
20:20 <moriarty> jmalicki, https://www.kitco.com/Gold_Silver_Ratio_Charts/gold-silver-ratio-charts.html
20:21 <jmalicki> https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm
20:21 <jmalicki> moriarty++
20:22 <jmalicki> are there any common absolute fair valuation models for gold or silver?
20:24 <jmalicki> marginal_: gold is going up because it's the new bitcoin
20:25 <moriarty> jmalicki, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-28/gold-fix-study-shows-signs-of-decade-of-bank-manipulation.html - this is a fairly good valuation model for gold
20:25 <jmalicki> moriarty++
20:25 <jmalicki> oh no
20:25 <jmalicki> you need a bloomberg terminal to read it
20:26 <jmalicki> i can probably find elsewhere :)
20:27 <jmalicki> marginal_: if you know where to get a bb terminal for only $10k/yr hook me up
20:27 <jmalicki> notmike++ seriously?
20:28 <jmalicki> the list i've seen is $24k/yr
20:32 <moriarty> jmalicki, anyway in short, gold prices are positively correlated to commodity prices, money supply M2, and i suspect it may exhibit some kind of correlation with trade (im-)balance between the US and other countries
20:37 <moriarty> jmalicki, this appears to be non-paywalled - https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/london-gold-fix-may-have-been-manipulated-for-a-decade-study/articleshow/31202004.cms
20:59 <jmalicki> notmike i feel like documenting everything well helps hugely too
20:59 <jmalicki> if they see you're being detailed and explaining things they have less to look for
21:00 <jmalicki> moriarty: they have a giant backlog
21:00 <jmalicki> moriarty: even for times when an informant called in to report someone for cheating on taxes, they only get to something like 10%
21:01 <jmalicki> even they even had enough staff to pursue tips of evasion, that would be an increase
21:01 <jmalicki> moriarty: plus there are probably not-directly-measured gains to enforcement, since you'd have fewer attempt to cheat if they know they have a better chance of getting caught
21:02 <jmalicki> _Sam-- what is bad about that?
21:02 <jmalicki> as2333 and if you try to get around that, you'll end up using the NSA's bitcoin mixer
21:02 <jmalicki> as2333 why, it's great for bitcoin!
21:02 <jmalicki> as2333 anything that increases regulation can only help bitcoin
21:03 <as2333> jmalicki, maybe =) - But hopefully there will be a lot of mixers.
21:03 <as2333> jmalicki, even p2p mixers.
21:03 <jmalicki> as2333 yes, and using a mixer can be considered tainted
21:03 <moriarty> jmalicki, that's a good point +1
21:03 <as2333> jmalicki, are you aware of bitcoin's origin?
21:03 <jmalicki> use a mixer, get arrested for money laundering
21:04 <as2333> jmalicki, oh yes. And your government can execute pot slmokers. That would reduce the amount of criminals who smoke pot.
21:04 <jmalicki> or monero
21:07 <as2333> jmalicki, so are you aware of what kind of people is responsible for bitcoin building blocks and likely bitcoin itself?
21:08 <jmalicki> as2333 i don't know who satoshi is, no
21:08 <as2333> jmalicki, so you know nothing about bitcoin's history?
21:08 <jmalicki> are you claiming to know who satoshi is?
21:08 <as2333> jmalicki, come on
21:10 <as2333> jmalicki, did you read the bitcoin white paper?
21:10 <jmalicki> as2333 like 8 years ago
21:10 <as2333> jmalicki, and you didn't check the citations?
21:11 <jmalicki> it was 8 years ago
21:11 <as2333> jmalicki, you don't know what hashcash? b-money? rpow? bitgokd?
21:12 <as2333> jmalicki, you never heard of tim may?
21:12 <jmalicki> no
21:12 <jmalicki> nope
21:16 <jmalicki> or yahoo ;P
21:16 <jmalicki> i bet targeting ICOs at people who still use yahoo mail is probably good fishing
21:18 <jmalicki> dispersed: are you including random token in crypto as a whole?
21:21 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: not particularly unusual
21:22 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: lol
21:22 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: during price discovery things get volatile
21:23 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: price discovery?
21:24 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: when underlying facts change, the market has to redetermine what fair prices for assets are
21:24 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: so various people with different knowledge and views buy or sell
21:24 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: whats changed?
21:24 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: and it can sometimes be bumpy, as the news of price going up or down means people who thought it was fair before now may act
21:25 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: tariffs, tax plan taking effect (it was only passed a short time ago), likely fed actions
21:25 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: these are all very big changes for the market
21:25 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like with a new tax plan, even every earnings report can update people's guidance on the likely effects
21:26 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: since more data about the projections can revise exactly what prices things should have
21:26 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: also there's talk about interference of regulation in tech with all the news about facebook etc
21:26 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: there are lots...
21:26 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings/
21:27 <jmalicki> moriarty: you don't need law when you have tokens!
21:27 <moriarty> lol jmalicki
21:27 <jmalicki> moriarty: just build token-based escrow
21:27 <jmalicki> moriarty: i mean cryptocurrency does give us our best shot yet
21:28 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: but like this is a huge time for markets, since so much is changing
21:28 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: so much that has been pretty stable for 30 years+ is going through major revision
21:28 <jmalicki> so it's gonna mean a lot of price discovery
21:29 <jmalicki> moriarty: you don't actually get the money until you deliver
21:29 <jmalicki> moriarty: like have a state where "noone" has the money
21:30 <jmalicki> like crypto acknowledges the escrow
21:30 <jmalicki> and you no longer have access
21:30 <jmalicki> neither does the other party
21:31 <jmalicki> moriarty: that's not legal anymore at least (it was legal five years ago)
21:31 <moriarty> jmalicki, that's a great idea except that i thought that was the whole point of fundraising :P for them to be able to deliver, they need those funds
21:32 <jmalicki> moriarty: yeah, tether really needs 2 billion to deliver some software
21:32 <jmalicki> err sorry
21:32 <jmalicki> telegram
21:32 <jmalicki> moriarty: freudian slip ;P
21:32 <jmalicki> _Sam-- that quickly becomes a market for lemons
21:33 <jmalicki> _Sam-- if I have a car that would cost $10k to buy, but $6k to sell
21:33 <jmalicki> _Sam-- i'm way less likely to sell, so if you see a car for sale, you know it's broken
21:33 <jmalicki> _Sam-- no, it's way more than adjusting for the %
21:33 <jmalicki> _Sam-- a 1% scam rate can lead to a 50% price drop
21:33 <jmalicki> it's not proportional
21:33 <notmike> jmalicki: oh yeah bigly I think
21:34 <_Sam--> jmalicki you can flood the box with as many useless numbers and words as you want
21:34 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/03/19/tether-primary-reserve-bank-puerto-rico-says-bitmex/
21:34 <moriarty> jmalicki, bitmex did some great research on tether that shows basically it's fully reserved
21:34 <jmalicki> moriarty++ interesting
21:35 <jmalicki> wait
21:35 <jmalicki> if i move to puerto rico, i no longer have to pay federal us income tax?
21:35 <jmalicki> seriously?
21:37 <jmalicki> damn
21:37 <moriarty> jmalicki, lol now you know
21:38 <jmalicki> moriarty: ok, so i still pay 3% FICA but can earn millions and not pay 39% personal income tax
21:38 <jmalicki> *shrug*
21:38 <jmalicki> other federal taxes are rounding errors
21:39 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: how long have you been in the market
21:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, yep
21:40 <moriarty> jmalicki, as long as you're not a USG employee, and are residing in PR you pay no personal income taxes
21:51 <jmalicki> _Sam-- i heard it was at least 3 that have filed charges so far
21:51 <jmalicki> _Sam-- err court cases not charges
21:51 <jmalicki> _Sam-- if you count melania it's at least 4
23:18 <jmalicki> kaner wat?
23:19 <jmalicki> kaner i mean whisky or port is more common, but people mix red wine
23:19 <jmalicki> kaner you'd rather pair it with a pinot gris?
23:27 <jmalicki> you forgot to use synergies in that sentence
23:27 <jmalicki> i mean look at the iphone
23:28 <jmalicki> the iphone had basically been invented 20 years before
23:28 <jmalicki> it was a little lighter and had a little better battery life etc.
23:28 <jmalicki> or facebook even!
23:29 <jmalicki> na twitter is such a bad idea noone else had it first :)
23:29 <latentprion> jmalicki++
23:42 <moriarty> as2333, as jmalicki pointed out, synergy is one way you combine unoriginal ideas in original ways to tighten your costs of production, and up the quality experience for your users
01:40 <jmalicki> B132 we don't talk about econometrics here, only crypto trading
01:40 <jmalicki> B132
01:40 <jmalicki> B132 ## in an irc channel name means everything but
01:44 <jmalicki> B132 how do you feel about regime switching models between periods of markets in periods of momentum vs mean reversion?
01:45 <notmike> jmalicki is an insufferable Bayesian, for example.
01:45 <jmalicki> B132 hmm are currency exchanges interesting?  I was under the impression they're mostly just casinos with a huge house advantage and lots of leverage so people go bust
01:45 <jmalicki> notmike: lots of people, that's part of the reason FX is popular
01:46 <jmalicki> notmike: "you'll offer me 100x leverage? if i make 1% per day times 100, i could be a billionaire in no time!"
01:46 <jmalicki> if you moderate yourself it's fine
01:46 <jmalicki> but the leverage most offer is *far* in excess of what's reasonable
01:46 <jmalicki> even for the best quants on the planet
01:47 <jmalicki> and iiuc it's legal for FX houses to trade against you
01:47 <jmalicki> notmike: if you want to be
01:47 <jmalicki> B132: when i got a toenail fungus infection i built a forecasting model for when my toenail would grow back
01:48 <jmalicki> B132: the best work is boring
01:49 <jmalicki> B132 oh for that i built an AI to send targeted flirty emails to girls on personals sites based on profile details
01:49 <jmalicki> B132: i actually know multiple quants who have done this independently of each other
01:50 <B132> jmalicki: What work have you done?
01:53 <jmalicki> notmike: i used okcupid and chemistry
01:53 <jmalicki> notmike: but also that's part of the reason for doing it
01:53 <notmike> jmalicki: share your code?
01:54 <jmalicki> notmike: if 90% are fake, and the algorithm sends the flirty email, you don't waste time
01:54 <jmalicki> notmike: it's lost on the same crashed harddrive w/ my 50 btc, and sadly i have no backup
01:54 <jmalicki> notmike: the code's probably more valuable than the 50btc
01:54 <jmalicki> (50btc from 2011)
01:55 <jmalicki> notmike: i can describe it
01:55 <jmalicki> notmike: i mostly just looked at a bunch of profiles and highlighted a short quick flirty note mentioning something sort of unique in the profile
01:55 <jmalicki> notmike: scraped tons of profiles
01:56 <jmalicki> notmike: made a machine learning model to identify something interesting to talk about and write a sentence
01:56 <jmalicki> notmike: then had it generate tons of sentences and did active learning at the margin where i accepted or rewrote sentences
01:57 <jmalicki> notmike: it didn't have to be brilliant, the point was to write something more interesting then spamming everyone with "sup girl" and see if they respond
01:57 <jmalicki> notmike: less than that
01:57 <jmalicki> notmike: like "i see you're into skiing, have you ever been to ...." or something
01:58 <jmalicki> trying to evoke a response at all
01:58 <jmalicki> if someone responds, i can act as a human
01:58 <jmalicki> and i eliminated 95% of the work composing emails to people who won't respond
01:59 <jmalicki> but the point was to get to "this person read my profile and thinks i'm interesting" without having to read their profile or think about them
02:00 <jmalicki> neither husband nor wife, but within two weeks i had two girlfriends and three fwbs
02:01 <jmalicki> i eventually found a long term partner in a more traditional way
02:01 <jmalicki> lol
02:01 <jmalicki> notmike: have you had deep fried twinkies?
02:01 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: deviantart?
02:01 <notmike> jmalicki: chicks on those sites are often damaged, and the men are uh well...
02:01 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: I hate them too
02:01 <as2333> jmalicki, and you got lots of replies from bots?
02:02 <jmalicki> as2333 no real people
02:02 <as2333> jmalicki, did you do a turing test?
02:02 <jmalicki> as2333 it wasn't sophisticated enough for that, it just did an opening line
02:02 <as2333> jmalicki, nvm it was a dumb joke on my part
02:03 <jmalicki> like the biggest bang for the buck was just finding the women who were real and active users who were potentially even vaguely interested
02:03 <jmalicki> since that's a HUGE timesuck on personals sites
02:03 <jmalicki> jeffree yes and no, you can vary how complex you make it
02:03 <jmalicki> jeffree i made it more complex and more ambitious based on interest
02:03 <jmalicki> and more ambitious and better probably gets you moderately higher hit rates
02:03 <jmalicki> but my point is it's not like impossibly complex
02:04 <jeffree> jmalicki: did you do any kind of research about what kind of introductory statements/questions tend to result in responses/success?
02:04 <jmalicki> the real challenge is just finding which users are real, and showing that you have some interest and can read their profile
02:04 <jmalicki> jeffree a little, but not really enough data to do a lot
02:04 <jmalicki> jeffree since the total numbers of those who responded at all was still in only triple digits over like a year
02:05 <jmalicki> jeffree: still for personals sites, usually the vast majority of people never respond
02:05 <jmalicki> jeffree: so it cuts out a huge amount of work
02:05 <jmalicki> yep
02:06 <jmalicki> jeffree: basically i was trying to automate the first 2 minutes of hitting on a girl, no more than that
02:06 <jmalicki> since that's the highest reject rate/most boring and tedious part
02:07 <jmalicki> jeffree: but various levels are pretty attainable
02:07 <jmalicki> jeffree: oh people have tons
02:07 <jmalicki> jeffree: like i have friends who find someone they really like and compose a two page email and don't hear back
02:07 <notmike> jmalicki is such a lover
02:08 <jmalicki> like you have to get over "one-itis" first
02:08 <jeffree> jmalicki: that makes me sad
02:08 <jmalicki> and realize it's a numbers game
02:08 <jmalicki> but once you're there, this is a way to quickly find girls who might be vaguely interested enough in you to read your message and write two sentences back
02:08 <jmalicki> like, eliminate the people just not active on the site, or who reject you out of hand
02:09 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: k
02:09 <jmalicki> notmike: that requires more work
02:09 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: when I see that, I assume they have their shit going on
02:09 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: any company with the audacity to use comic sans just doesn't give a fuck
02:10 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: and it's a way of saying fuck you i'm not gonna fake it, i know my shit
02:10 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: it's like when mark zuckerberg wears a hoodie instead of a suit
02:10 <jmalicki> not even pointy white hoods?
02:11 <jmalicki> they're in fashion these days
02:11 <jmalicki> ...
02:12 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: what ;)
02:12 <jmalicki> notmike: yes, that's the point of automating that part
02:12 <jmalicki> notmike: they know on 30 seconds, and on a personals site, they want to see that you're also interested enough to have at least read their profile
02:13 <jmalicki> notmike: it's about getting past that
02:13 <jmalicki> nothing more
02:13 <jmalicki> which isn't actually all that hard to write
02:15 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: do you live in san francisco?
02:17 <jmalicki> Stooge: $99 in fluid green (out of stock), $199 everything else
02:17 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: nope the color!
02:18 <jmalicki> Stooge: nothing weird, add a low price in something you're out of stock in
02:18 <jmalicki> Stooge: if everyone thinks that color is super ugly and they can't move inventory
02:18 <jmalicki> Stooge: then they have to put it on sale
02:19  * jmalicki prefers goretex fleece and a goretex shell
02:19 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: yeah this is more like modernized goretex
02:20 <jmalicki> Stooge: it is nanotechnology http://www.patagonia.com/primaloft.html
02:20 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: oh ok part of their site said primaloft was part of nanopuff
02:20 <jmalicki> http://www.patagonia.com/nano-puff.html
02:21 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: what Im saying is
02:21 <jmalicki> "This season we’re proud to be the first to use this revolutionary 55% recycled polyester insulation in all our Nano Puff® styles."
02:21 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: well, primaloft uses nanotechnology, and the jacket is called nanopuff
02:21 <jmalicki> so maybe the nano does refer to the nanotechnology?
02:21 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: no, because its a smaller lighter micropuff.
02:22 <jmalicki> ah ok
02:22 <jmalicki> and the millipuff
02:22 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: but yeah, I didnt want a heavy duty outer shell
02:22 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i guess i like layers
02:23 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: so every day i can get my shell, and choose medium fleece, heavy fleece, or vest
02:23 <jmalicki> depending on temp, and maybe change during the day
02:23 <jmalicki> oh, three winters in boston made me not cost sensitive ;)
02:24 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: boston tends to get more snow than maine
02:24 <jmalicki> as i would drive to maine in every snowstorm when boston got shut down to ski
02:25 <jmalicki> every time i heard there was likely to be a sheter in place order due to snow, i would drive to sunday river
02:25 <jmalicki> ok you're also a bit north ;)
02:25 <jmalicki> and yeah you have the effect from the gulf
02:25 <jmalicki> like boston
02:25 <jmalicki> inland maine doesn't get that as bbad
02:27 <jmalicki> but haven't to walk to work in 0degreeF temps constantly does suck
02:27 <jmalicki> having not haven't
02:27 <jmalicki> and boston got that all the time
02:27 <jmalicki> yep
02:27 <jmalicki> the snow i don't mind so much
02:28 <jmalicki> it's walking into starbucks for a break on my commute, and barely being able to order because my face is frozen ;P
02:28 <jmalicki> lol
02:28 <jmalicki> i liked the snow, it was just the below 10 degree days
02:28 <jmalicki> above 10 degrees not so bad, just wear warm clothes
02:29 <jmalicki> below 10 started to suck
02:29 <jmalicki> oh yeah you have the latitude too
02:29 <jmalicki> and short days
02:29 <jmalicki> new england builds character.
02:30 <notmike> jmalicki: you went to school in Boston?
02:30 <jmalicki> notmike: worked there for 12 year
02:30 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: don't you worry about ice getting caught in it?
02:30 <notmike> jmalicki: damn I wicked smart, huh?
02:30 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: nope
02:30 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: its better than any ski mask
02:31 <jmalicki> no way, the serius are awesome
02:31 <jmalicki> like a beard doesn't even cover your nose or lips
02:31 <jmalicki> lol
02:32 <jmalicki> these changed my life https://www.saintbernard.com/seirus-neofleece-combo-scarf-style-2705.html?sb_color=177&sb_size=164&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtOLVBRCZARIsADPLtJ16lhlIAl-wMdH8oj0FGdftLPWwDTaog6EyhOyN2x5J8HeWnXH9AP4aApVZEALw_wcB
02:32 <jmalicki> when i lived in boston
02:32 <jmalicki> (moreso for skiing when i'd be outside for 10 hours)
02:32 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: but yeah like
02:33 <jmalicki> yeah fuck cotton when its wet and col
02:33 <jmalicki> wool is great but expensive
02:33 <jmalicki> also ski pants
02:33 <jmalicki> i would sometimes wear ski pants to work on bad days
02:33 <jmalicki> yeah but it's like a shell for your pants
02:33 <jmalicki> your jeans don't get cold and wet
02:34 <jmalicki> oh i hear you
02:34 <jmalicki> i was just like this sucks so bad, i don't care about cheap anymore
02:34 <jmalicki> i like marmot a lot
02:35 <jmalicki> i don't doubt your shopping skills
02:35 <jmalicki> it's just interesting to contrast experiences with someone who had to deal w/ similar shit
02:35 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: my marmot shell did start to get some tears etc after 4 years
02:35 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i mean, i'm a former new englander ;)
02:36 <jmalicki> but yeah, people here like have no idea
02:36 <jmalicki> they go to tahoe and its 20F like omfg it's sooo cold
02:36 <jmalicki> like it's not even windy
02:36 <jmalicki> try main when it's -10F and 60mph winds
02:37 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: btw whats weird as fuck is
02:37 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: you can get away with tshirts and shorts at 30F if you're active
02:38 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: that's the nice thing about layering
02:38 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: you don't need as much heft with multiple layers
02:38 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: no i mean like, wear a tshirt, then a sweater, then maybe a medium weight thing, then a shell
02:38 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: each layer of air helps
02:39 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: the multiple layers of air are a bigger deal than weight
02:41 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: like, most of the shit I wore was like, walmart or jc penny or sears kinds of jackets
02:41 <jmalicki> Diablo-D3: but you can layer anything
02:42 <jmalicki> i mean once i discovered goretex i was like fuck it money is no object, i'd rather have a goretex jacket than a car
02:42 <jmalicki> lol
02:43 <Diablo-D3> jmalicki: but yeah like
03:11 <jmalicki> Crusher: what was the reason? suspicion of being a professional, or using their api?
03:11 <Crusher> jmalicki: it didn't say.... I haven't be using it at all... didn't even know I had it
03:12 <jmalicki> Crusher: the NYSE has been cracking down hard on their legal requirements to extract more money from people
03:12 <jmalicki> it could be related somehow
18:38 <jmalicki> bobke nah, when sp500 collapses the investment goes into propping up house prices instead
18:39 <jmalicki> bobke not so if it's supported by actual money
18:39 <jmalicki> Randolf maybe you could be responsible and respond to incentives
18:40 <Randolf> jmalicki:  It seems like irresponsibility is what's being rewarded though.
18:40 <jmalicki> in the face of those facts, anyone who doesn't borrow too much is simply irresponsible and of poor character
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf no, your concepts about responsibility are clearly off
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf if you're responsible to yourself, shouldn't you do what helps you the most?
18:40 <jmalicki> think about your family
18:40 <jmalicki> Randolf exactly
18:41 <jmalicki> Randolf learn from our president
18:41 <jmalicki> smart business people use strategic bankruptcy as a tool
18:41 <jmalicki> just create many uncorrelated shell corporations and bankrupt the losers
18:41 <jmalicki> Randolf apparently so
18:44 <jmalicki> Randolf only shortly after the birth of your child
18:46 <jmalicki> Randolf ethics is an important part of ones' education
19:17 <Randolf> jmalicki:  I agree.
05:44 < jmalicki> fentanyl usually doesn't cause long-term addiction
05:45 < jmalicki> coffee is good for the liver
05:45 < jmalicki> in moderate doses
05:46 < jmalicki> (coffee is both good and bad for the liver, in moderate doses the good outwieghs the bad)
05:46 < Schwarzbaer> jmalicki, that comment about fentanyl, is that along the lines of "All mushrooms are edible; some are edible just once."?
05:46 < jmalicki> Scwarzbaer yes
05:50 < jmalicki> ibttis that usually implies solo
05:51 < jmalicki> and low quality
05:51 < jmalicki> woah
06:02 < jmalicki> notmike yeah that's the problem
06:27 < notmike> jmalicki?
06:27 < jmalicki> umm
06:28 < jmalicki> i know nothing about testing or dealing with causality other than through reinforcement learning.
06:28 < jmalicki> so that's interesting to me.
06:29 < jmalicki> oh crypto looks easy as hell but i haven't tried yet
06:29 < jmalicki> 1) get a fuck ton of historical data
06:29 < jmalicki> that's the painful part
06:30 < jmalicki> then fit a pattern?
06:30 < goodblood> jmalicki is the institutional volume guppie guy
06:30 < jmalicki> ?
06:30 < jmalicki> i dunno what that means
06:31 < jmalicki> notmike i'd do something like try lagged bid and ask interest, some variables for the book, price change over various periods, throw them in a random forest
06:31 < jmalicki> lagged across maybe 10 or 20 periods
06:31 < jmalicki> maybe with exponentially increasing gaps?
06:32 < jmalicki> you probably want to do like pct diffs not absolutes too
06:32 < jmalicki> but maybe some variables for psychological support levels
06:32 < jmalicki> notmike for recent trends vs seasonality
06:33 < jmalicki> no, like dprice/dt/price
06:34 < jmalicki> like detrended log price
06:34 < jmalicki> this is throwing shit out there
06:35 < jmalicki> notmike so like, you don't have enough data to discover trends at every possible minute lag
06:35 < jmalicki> but you care about what's happening the last few seconds, minutes, and hours
06:35 < jmalicki> plus to care about whether or not in the past week it's a bbear or bull market
06:35 < jmalicki> hence the exponential
06:35 < jmalicki> every minute for the last week will be too many variables to fit
06:36 < jmalicki> once you have the data it takes like an hour in R
06:36 < jmalicki> to get a first pass
06:56 < jmalicki> ya
06:57 < jmalicki> but like make the recency of the data an explicit column
06:57 < jmalicki> like have a feature vector with the same data at various stages
06:57 < jmalicki> and predict the next interval price based on the vector
06:57 < jmalicki> and maybe not perfectly exponential
06:58 < jmalicki> like hour/day/week for older data etc
06:58 < jmalicki> or whatever recurrence and seasonality patterns you might suspect
07:01 < jmalicki> this is extremely handwavy of course
07:01 < jmalicki> realistic you're going to learn a lot and adjust course a lot very very quickly once you actually try
08:09 < jmalicki> it was the ultimate other
08:09 < jmalicki> the Muslim Ban?

08:09 < Entitlement> jmalicki - [ Immigration Act of 1924 - Wikipedia ] 
08:10 < jmalicki> notmike i think it was more indifference among the majority
08:10 < jmalicki> like "what's a chinese? whatever i have no objection"
08:14 < jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: yeah, noone is one thing
08:14 < notmike> jmalicki: the quotas just took the census (1920, I think) and said "we're going to allow immigrants in the same protein as their share of the population then" Chinese Exclusion Act on the other hand barred *all* Chinese and even many other Asian peoples
08:15 < jmalicki> protein is a freudian slip
08:22 < ThriftyDillo> jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: yeah, noone is one thing << the Chinese are perhaps more diverse than the US States
20:16 < jmalicki> notmike why doesn't it apply to cryptocurrencies?
20:16 < jmalicki> notmike every weakness of the definition to crypto also applies to equities
20:16 < jmalicki> yet it's still extremely useful
20:17 < jmalicki> notmike it does have a real meaning, it's what the market values bitcoin at
20:17 < jmalicki> if a holder of bitcoin valued it less than that, they would sell
20:17 < jmalicki> thus reducing the market cap
20:17 < notmike> jmalicki: you're assuming rational actors
20:18 < jmalicki> all people are rational, their goals just might be different than what you assume
20:18 < jmalicki> some people derive sentimental value from holding bitcoin
20:18 < jmalicki> or think they can get girls by having bitcoin
20:19 < jmalicki> i'm amazed how many people miss that buffet's key wealth creation mechanism is hacking the credit risk spread
20:20 < ibttis> jmalicki and scrapping companies that still have some life in them
20:20 < jmalicki> he couples companies that need to borrow with insurers that need to invest
20:20 < jmalicki> ibttis if they don't meet market rates of return that's not life

17:25 < whatsupboy> jmalicki:  ICo = initial coin offering right?
17:25 < jmalicki> ya, it's kind of like a bank heist but different
17:26 < jmalicki> nonono
17:26 < jmalicki> you just sell random ass coin
17:26 < jmalicki> and then you don't owe anyone anything
17:26 < jmalicki> no you make your own coin

17:26 < jmalicki> great way to fund something
17:29 < jmalicki> louipc you do need to do the regulations if you want to avoid jailtime.

17:32 < jmalicki> the white collar criminal justice system moves very slowly

17:33 < jmalicki> they don't take riss
17:33 < jmalicki> risks
17:34 < jmalicki> well i dunno
17:34 < jmalicki> "not taking risks" isn't necessarily that great
17:35 < jmalicki> it's not so much that they succeed at everything
17:35 < jmalicki> it's that they don't step out unless they're sure they'll succeed

11:39 < jmalicki> budfox doesn't everyone hate the swedes?
11:47 < budfox> jmalicki: I think mostly Norwegians due historical reasons. They literally invaded the country, bullied its population and stole its natural resources. Then, when Norway got rich, all of a sudden Sweden wanted to be their best friends.
11:50 < jmalicki> budfox but didn't they do that to the finns and danes and lots of other people too?

11:53 < jmalicki> this is literally the first time in my life i've heard that
11:55 < budfox> jmalicki: I know they bullied the Finns as well, however at that time Finland was barely a country
11:56 < budfox> jmalicki: Denmark was too tiny and too strong, it was Norway who lost the most and suffered the greatest humiliation
11:57 < jmalicki> budfox they have their revenge... now swedes are immigrants on temporary labor visas to do dirty manual work like oil changes and housekeeping in norway
11:57 < Gud> jmalicki: we still have a high tech industry

18:59 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: interesting, having a real job made me go the other way
18:59 < jmalicki> it made me realize how little meritocracy there was and how much comes through inheritance and the good-ole-boys network
19:00 < RustyShackleford> jmalicki: so I think we both found ourselves with decent incomes and realized you still can't afford everything you want
19:00 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: oh i can afford more than i want
19:01 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: my objection is how wasteful and inefficient things are due to the power structure
19:01 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: i just don't want very much
19:01 < jmalicki> (of course, *actual communism* would make the problem 100x worse)
19:01 < jmalicki> capitalism is definitely the worst system except for all the others we've tried.
19:02 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: i have no belief that markets are efficient or reward useful things anymore
19:02 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: no, we need more regulations, but of different kinds.
19:02 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: 120% inheritance tax, etc.
19:03 < jmalicki> if your parents have money when they die you're in debt to the state
19:03 < RustyShackleford> jmalicki: wtf
19:03 < jmalicki> imprison any children of people who don't give away all their wealth to charity.
19:04 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: yeah, people should inherit nothing
19:04 < jmalicki> jeffree those people aren't actually productive
19:05 < jmalicki> just the ones who whine "i'm creating jobs!" when all they're doing is preventing the people from selling their own labor
19:06 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: true
19:07 < jmalicki> jeffree basically yes
19:08 < jmalicki> jeffree and inheritance is just another sort of monopoly
19:09 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: i think Schumpeter provides a charitable summary while being more modern and contrasting with more modern notions
19:09 < jmalicki> if you don't want to slog through Marx
19:09 < jmalicki> it's a long hard read
19:09 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: why not just free healthcare for all?
19:09 < jmalicki> why does it have to be national and single payer?
19:10 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: why not allow insurance companies to compete on service, so you can choose your implementation?
19:11 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: they all get reimbursed by the govt the same, but you can choose the one that best serves you
19:11 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like in much of western europe
19:11 < RustyShackleford> jmalicki: aren't insurance companies the reason that a tylenol costs 60 bucks here?
19:12 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: laws upholding hospital monopolies are a big part.
19:12 < jmalicki> yes, that too
19:12 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: but nationalized healthcare has the same issue
19:12 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: it will just line the pockets of big pharma
19:14 < jmalicki> europe pays less income tax and has free healthcare and college :)
19:17 < jmalicki> db yeah but the us has some of the highest taxes in the world
19:18 < jmalicki> well depends on where you are in income
19:18 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: taxes are higher for the median person in europe, waaay lower for higher income brackets
19:18 < jmalicki> dispersed: state taxes are very high as well, as well as FICA
19:19 < jmalicki> db 54% marginal thereabout
19:19 < jmalicki> dispersed plus 12% state tax and 3% self employment taxes
19:19 < jmalicki> dispersed: total of 54%
19:20 < jmalicki> (depends on state of course, but in NY or CA that tend to have higher incomes)
19:20 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: yep, if you're in NY or CA and in the highest brackets
19:20 < jmalicki> those make it even higher
19:21 < jmalicki> dispersed: fair, but it is higher than in *many* european countries
19:21 < jmalicki> dispersed: yeah, but it's not like that's a night and day difference
19:21 < jmalicki> it's higher
19:21 < jmalicki> but the US holds its own in high taxes
19:22 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: would be better if it were georgist
19:22 < jmalicki> ok partially georgist
19:24 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: lower income people in the US face a 76% marginal tax rate if you include the loss of benefits like food stamps as you move into higher incomes.
19:24 < jmalicki> beat that, western europe.
19:25 < RustyShackleford> jmalicki: marginal tax rate, explain?
19:25 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: the tax you pay on additional income
19:25 < jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like if you make $30000, and get a raise to $35000
19:25 < jmalicki> how much your taxes increase divided by $5000
19:26 < jmalicki> if you consider e.g. foodstamps to be a negative tax

14:50 < jmalicki> notmike one way i like to think of things like e.g. geometric mean is to think about the distribution of residuals
14:51 < jmalicki> notmike for some data, if you take the log first, then average, the residuals will get much tighter and will have higher statistical power
14:51 < jmalicki> so it's more representative
14:52 < jmalicki> notmike generally like, i want to summarize the data, how many bits do i need to describe the residuals after various summary measures?
14:56 < jmalicki> notmike another maybe bigger issue is that arithmetic mean is biased for skewed distributions

22:32 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, not enough to be pendamic.
22:32 < jmalicki> anoperatr: in california prescription cannabis is not taxed, only recreational cannabis
22:33 < notmike> jmalicki: one of the biggest advantages an excahnge has (although there are very likely many) is that they may custody funds in lieu of and otc kinda requires inventory
22:33 < jmalicki> notmike: are you talking about crypto?
22:33 < jmalicki> in the rest of the world exchanges don't hold funds
22:33 < [itchyjunk]> everyone is always talking about crapto in here, jmalicki 
22:34 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i'm not
22:34 < jmalicki> well except for FreedomCoin
22:34 < jmalicki> notmike: you can, if you get properly licensed
22:34 < notmike> jmalicki: is there a background check?
22:35 < jmalicki> notmike: i believe so... at the very least you have to talk about any negative shit and there are things like lifetime bans if you leave something out
22:35 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: finra
22:36 < jmalicki> notmike: like i was reading and one guy got a DUI and didn't report it and got banned from the finance industry for 2 years... they don't fuck around
22:36 < notmike> jmalicki: my concern is that even very old stuff will hold me back. I've been out of trouble for years but have violent arrests
22:36 < jmalicki> notmike: anything white collar is often a lifetime ban
22:36 < jmalicki> notmike you could ask a securities lawyer
22:37 < jmalicki> notmike i think FINRA is way more concerned about white collar crime like bernie madoff style shit
22:37 < jmalicki> notmike but you have to report everything and FINRA publishes it publicly for potential customers and employers to see
22:38 < jmalicki> everyone in finance has moral turptitude
22:38 < jmalicki> they just want to be sure you leave it out of the office
22:39 < jmalicki> notmike https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p004882.pdf
22:39 < Entitlement> jmalicki - [ produced: Acrobat Distiller 3.0 for Power Macintosh ] 
22:39 < jmalicki> notmike so violent felonies expire after 10 years, anything involving money lasts forever
22:39 < jmalicki> at least as i read it
22:40 < jmalicki> notmike but i'm not a lawyer and all that
22:40 < jmalicki> notmike as long as it didn't involve money
22:41 < jmalicki> steal another kid's lunch money, that's on you forever
22:44 < jmalicki> notmike in san francisco, it's illegal to ask about that until an offer is made
22:44 < jmalicki> notmike so they can withdraw an offer, but they need to already decide you're the best candidate before they find out
22:45 < jmalicki> notmike: so it would probably help
22:45 < notmike> jmalicki: That's usually how it happens. 1) Get an offer (contingent on background) 2) Background comes back 3) I get a letter with a third-party report and 5 days to correct or answer 4) HR 'disqualifies' me for the offer
22:45 < jmalicki> ah lame
22:46 < jmalicki> notmike: have you tried getting references in regard to character and notes from a lawyer and stuff?
22:46 < jmalicki> notmike: go to church and have your pastor talk about how you've found jesus?
22:47 < jmalicki> just curious
22:47 < jmalicki> i don't know how that stuff works
22:47 < jmalicki> but i feel like there must be ways some people get through that?
22:47 < notmike> jmalicki: Yes, I have several such letters from employers, professors I taught for, anger management professionals and such
22:47 < jmalicki> notmike: :(
22:47 < jmalicki> how long ago was it?
22:49 < jmalicki> notmike: from what i've heard the finance industry cares more about high credit card balances than assaulting a police office
22:49 < jmalicki> but they still might object
22:50 < jmalicki> especially in under 10 years
22:50 < jmalicki> anoperatr: it's not discrimination against a protected class
22:50 < jmalicki> anoperatr: all hiring decisions are discriminatory against some traits
22:50 < jmalicki> louipc: no, you go by leetcode
22:51 < notmike> jmalicki: well, my credit is great. I'll have to give it a second look. I know lots of banks and financial services companies like to hire vets
22:51 < jmalicki> notmike: i imagine that helps even more as a  story
22:51 < anoperatr> jmalicki, the critical factor is that it is discrimination by character and character inherits all that the person is, including being and personality
22:51 < louipc> jmalicki: lolnice
22:52 < louipc> jmalicki: does that prove work ethic
22:52 < jmalicki> "vet has trouble readjusting" is something that is unamerican to not sympathise with
22:52 < jmalicki> louipc it proves leetcode
22:52 < jmalicki> louipc it "proves merit"
22:52 < jmalicki> oh noone cares about that
22:53 < jmalicki> louipc https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-logic-behind-Google-rejecting-Max-Howell-the-author-of-Homebrew-for-not-being-able-to-invert-a-binary-tree/answer/Max-Howell?srid=hosEd&amp;share=1
22:53 < jmalicki> louipc doesn't matter what else he can do, he couldn't leetcode :)
22:53 < louipc> jmalicki: lol
22:54 < notmike> jmalicki: the real issue there IME is that the interviewer resonates with that message and wants to help me, gives me the offer. Then, some HR person who never met me, doesn't know anything about me being a vet or any of that, see the record and disqualifies me.
22:55 < jmalicki> notmike maybe go for smaller companies where there is less distance?
22:55 < jmalicki> i dunno sorry
22:55 < jmalicki> i don't have a clue what it's like
22:55 < jmalicki> just trying to help
22:56  * [itchyjunk] slaps jmalicki with his own privlage
22:56 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, all you have to do is assult an officer and you'll know exactly what its like
22:56 < jmalicki> "creating nanoseconds of performance improvement on the back end" are they actually not shitty enough that a nanosecond is noticeable?
22:57 < jmalicki> i'd love it if crypto exchanges worried about seconds of performance
22:57 < moriarty1> jmalicki, matching engines creak under peak loads :) so pretty much
22:58 < anoperatr> jmalicki, if the operations become redundant then a nanosecond might stack into real lag after a few hundred thousand iterations. This is just a guess though
22:59 < jmalicki> i mean that might be why they're slow
22:59 < jmalicki> worrying about nanoseconds of improvement rather than improving the core
22:59 < jmalicki> of how it works
22:59 < moriarty1> jmalicki, good point, they need good people to join them, they're making more money than they can hire new folks, i'm sure
23:00 < jmalicki> moriarty1: yes, hiring is hard
23:00 < anoperatr> jmalicki, is education to blame?
23:00 < jmalicki> anoperatr: yes. not enough people get stanford cs phds
23:01 < jmalicki> anoperatr: MIT or CMU might be acceptable if the company is desperate ;P
23:02 < jmalicki> louipc there is. making a matching engine work fast and get seconds of improvement? that is likely a phd
23:02 < jmalicki> louipc: sure, but often a phd can do things with 1000x the impact of the low hanging fruit
23:02 < jmalicki> louipc: well like the talk i had with someone about google
23:02 < jmalicki> louipc: after google got to $1b in revenue, most of the low hanging fruit was done
23:03 < jmalicki> louipc: but there was plenty of impossible shit they needed to tackle to get to $100B
23:03 < jmalicki> once you hit revenue and it's rolling in and you're having a tough time keeping up
23:03 < jmalicki> that's when you start hiring phds etc
23:04 < jmalicki> "this problem cannot be solved with current technology. fix it"
23:04 < jmalicki> louipc: someone needed to write Hadoop, Cassandra, AWS etc
23:05 < jmalicki> louipc: someone needed to create bitcoin
23:05 < jmalicki> those aren't low hanging fruit
23:05 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, do you have a PhD?
23:05 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: no, masters dropout
23:05 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i found my niche and wasn't worth it anymore
23:06 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: applied math
23:06 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, if thats what oyu want
23:06 < jmalicki> i'm not smart enough for pure math
23:06 < jmalicki> phds are great, most people just don't know how to manage them or use them to create value
23:07 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, you're established
23:07 < jmalicki> if you can manage phds to create shit on the cusp of research
23:07 < jmalicki> it's a wonderful niche
23:07 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i may at some point, but i still have work to do
23:07 < louipc> jmalicki: i dunno
23:07 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i'd love to get a phd in math when i retire
23:07 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, isn't it apply to PhD program, wait 10 years and do a defense?
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: they are.
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: it's tough to manage
23:08 < merlincorey> jmalicki: publish or die
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: but they can be brilliant
23:08 < louipc> jmalicki: that means they cant spend time on one thing to squeeze the most out of it 
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: sometimes someone will do jack shit for 6 months, then just make you a million dollars
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: correct
23:08 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, what do you need to accomplish before you think of PhD seriously?
23:08 < merlincorey> jmalicki: at least in maths you can write a multi hundred page paper that will take people years to unravel and determine you were full of shit
23:08 < jmalicki> louipc: or they wander in the clouds until the inspiration hits them
23:09 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: grow into one of the world's leading quantitative hedge funds and train successors
23:09 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, ohh.. so you just want to make more money
23:10 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: it's not about the money
23:10 < louipc> jmalicki: yea i guess. think outside the box is kewl
23:10 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: it's about creating the world's best AI
23:10 < jmalicki> and the best workplace culture
23:10 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, you're defining best AI by how well it can make money
23:10 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: well, it's a great way to fund it
23:11 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: yep
23:11 < jmalicki> merlincorey: the stock market is
23:12 < jmalicki> the hard thing about the stock market etc is that it's competitive
23:12 < jmalicki> you get 0 credit unless you're the smartest person in the world about your niche
23:12 < jmalicki> (in expectation)
23:14 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i think current techniques are adequate, the problem is few managers outside of google and rentech are comfortable with a black box
23:15 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: humans want to feel in control rather than subservient to computers
23:15 < jmalicki> most people are, that's why the opportunity exists
23:15 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: and? they have the same cardinality
23:16 < jmalicki> just a different algebra
23:16 < jmalicki> it's no more expressive
23:16 < jmalicki> well, maybe that will be an advance
23:16 < jmalicki> but current technology is rarely put to its limits
23:17 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: they're not. they're creating it, the only thing they've applied it to is HVAC
23:17 < jmalicki> people need to be applying that technology to business problems
23:17 < jmalicki> not make it win more video games
23:17 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: yes!
23:18 < jmalicki> that's why there's money in it
23:18 < jmalicki> its boring
23:20 < jmalicki> moriarty1: nice!
23:20 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i am!
23:21 < [itchyjunk]> jmalicki, must be some good drugs.
23:21 < jmalicki> [itchyjunk]: i'm plugged into the matrix and loving it
23:22 < jmalicki> moriarty1: i really like the dude with orange pants and purple halloween socks
23:22 < moriarty1> jmalicki, lol he's too cool for the suit :)
23:23 < jmalicki> moriarty1: but the guy in the augur shirt is impressive
23:24 < moriarty1> jmalicki, yeah they really know what they're talking about, plenty of smart people in the space
23:24 < jmalicki> moriarty1: i'm not sure about the guy in the orange pants
23:24 < jmalicki> i'm impressed by the augur guy though
23:24 < jmalicki> moriarty1: he understands the deeper market needs and not just parrotting the hype
23:25 < jmalicki> moriarty1: he's not making predictions of bitcoin going up etc., but has a thesis about why the market will accept it
23:25 < jmalicki> joey krug
23:26 < moriarty1> jmalicki, yeah pantera capital is one of the more well-known names in the crypto hedge fund space
23:27 < moriarty1> jmalicki, _4matter, https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-unicorn-hunters-the-vc-firms-behind-billion-dollar-crypto-startups/
23:27 < jmalicki> moriarty1++
23:28 < jmalicki> Mike Volpi!
23:28 < jmalicki> small world
23:29 < moriarty1> jmalicki, Dan Morehead is a Princetonian who heads the outfit and he has a prestigious background having been at Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs, and i believe he's working with Novogratz too on a collaborative fund
23:29 < jmalicki> moriarty1: joey krug is someone who could convince me crypto matters
23:30 < jmalicki> i'm not sure i believe it
23:30 < jmalicki> but he has a compelling thesis
23:31 < jmalicki> it's not "other people are into it and there are trends"
23:31 < jmalicki> but "there are fundamental market failures at play and cryptocurrencies can solve them"
23:32 < jmalicki> there are only two things universities are good at teaching IMO: writing and mathematical proofs
23:32 < jmalicki> literally almost everything else is better learned on your own imo
23:32 < jmalicki> only things where you need to pay someone else to critique your work because you can't test it in the market is where you need a university
23:33 < jmalicki> and i wrote that sentence, so i could use more education in writing :)
23:34 < jmalicki> yeah the relationships are nice
23:36 < jmalicki> moriarty1: yeah i feel like a lot of.. i hesitate to use the word second tier...  but schools like Brown, Harvey Mudd, Pomona, Williams etc. are way better than like Harvard for that reason
23:37 < jmalicki> they put a little more emphasis on teaching and less on research
23:37 < jmalicki> but without lowering standards much
23:37 < jmalicki> if you're like an IMO winner or something sure you need Harvard's level of research talent to challenge you
23:38 < jmalicki> but like 80% of harvard's students would probably get more out of brown, at least *education* wise
23:38 < jmalicki> omg the dude in the orange pants works at Hero City
23:39 < jmalicki> makes sense he is full of nonsense
23:39 < jmalicki> "has always had infinite" wtf
23:39 < moriarty1> jmalicki, i won't be surprised if you were bang on with that assessment given that the competition is a lot stiffer at first tiers between academics in chasing after the funding pot
23:40 < jmalicki> moriarty1: well brown is ivy, but it's probably the most LAC of the ivies
23:41 < jmalicki> it's got a little bit of a different culture than the rest
23:41 < moriarty1> jmalicki, that's probably why emma watson got in :P
23:41 < jmalicki> lol
23:42 < jmalicki> of course i haven't gone to all of the ivies
23:42 < jmalicki> just know enough people to get stereotypes
23:42 < jmalicki> lol
23:46 < jmalicki> moriarty1: oooh the dude in the orange pants is adam draper, must be john draper's son
23:46 < jmalicki> i just....
23:46 < jmalicki> Draper University and Hero City are the douchiest things in the entire world
23:46 < jmalicki> and like a mile away from me so i walk by all the time
23:48 < moriarty1> jmalicki, you're in San Mateo? sweet deal
23:48 < jmalicki> moriarty1: burlingame, the next small city north
23:49 < jmalicki> moriarty1: nice til about boosted :)
23:49 < jmalicki> lime bikes and scooters are the new hotness
23:49 < jmalicki> but only in the burbs
23:50 < jmalicki> in SF they agressively confiscate all of that shit now
23:50 < moriarty1> jmalicki, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2i0PcJ2B7w :-) they're the next best thing if you're on your way to a Lamborghini
23:50 < jmalicki> oh it's somethig you buy not rent with an app?
23:50 < jmalicki> idlework i really like the scooters
23:50 < jmalicki> like lime and bird
23:51 < notmike> jmalicki: 1st paragraph last page of https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p004882.pdf
23:52 < jmalicki> notmike: huh
23:52 < jmalicki> notmike: i also don't know if anything went forward
23:52 < jmalicki> notmike: the status quo pre that memo was disclose everything
23:52 < jmalicki> notmike: and this was a proposal hmm
23:53 < jmalicki> notmike: i still have a lot of work to do before i could knee-deep in FINRA
23:53 < jmalicki> so after watching that video
23:53 < jmalicki> Joey Krug is the only one i would put my own money behind
23:54 < jmalicki> the others might be able to win
23:54 < jmalicki> but they can't articulate the value they provide well enough

23:56 < jmalicki> and fix them
23:56 < moriarty1> jmalicki, yeah well, bitcoin is where it's at :) as smart as they all sound, you can't beat the collective intelligence behind the 9-years running dominant coin
23:57 < jmalicki> moriarty1: there are many trends that come and go
23:58 < moriarty1> jmalicki, are you still with Nokia these days?
23:58 < jmalicki> moriarty1: that was years ago
23:58 < jmalicki> what a fucked up org
23:58 < jmalicki> moriarty1: i don't recall stable allocations...
23:58 < jmalicki> moriarty1: but after work a few coworkers and i drank whisky and did game theory on a whiteboard until 2am
23:58 < jmalicki> great time
23:58 < moriarty1> jmalicki, trends are supported by the intellectual powerhouse behind it :D
23:59 < moriarty1> jmalicki, are you still working in telco or?
23:59 < jmalicki> moriarty1: joey krug satoshi and the ethereum guy are the only ones to impress me as intellectual powerhouses sofar
23:59 < jmalicki> moriarty1: after nokia was a hedge fund then yelp ads now fulltime on my hft thing
00:00 < moriarty1> jmalicki, well, i don't know too much about augur, but ethereum and bitcoin are great choices :)
00:00 < jmalicki> moriarty1: i think augur was just one of his investments
00:01 < jmalicki> he didn't create it did he?
00:01 < moriarty1> jmalicki, very nice :D was this a well-known HF?
00:01 < jmalicki> i only googled him for like 3m
00:01 < moriarty1> jmalicki, i think he founded Augur
00:01 < jmalicki> moriarty1: small. 5 people. i was the only quant. was rated by one mag the best performing equity market neutral hf, but it was abusive so i left
00:02 < jmalicki> moriarty1: but was interesting, got to build a deep learning system to detect management teams lying or hedging in earnings calls
00:02 < jmalicki> moriarty1: a very interesting 90 hours a week
00:03 < jmalicki> moriarty1: well, more narrow
00:03 < jmalicki> moriarty1: it was a spinoff of a company of ex-CIA interrogators who consulted for corporate interrogations
00:03 < jmalicki> and one thing led to anothe
00:03 < ldlework> jmalicki: moriarty1 what's the role of machine-learning in finance today?
00:04 < jmalicki> Idlework lots of things
00:04 < jmalicki> Idlework reacting to news
00:04 < jmalicki> Idlework short term quant stuff
00:04 < jmalicki> idlework i think you can reasonably call portfolio optimization machine learning
00:04 < jmalicki> depends how narrowly you define machine learning i guess
00:04 < jmalicki> idlework yes and no
00:05 < jmalicki> idlework a lot of methods are specialized to small data sets
00:05 < jmalicki> idlework like a lot of bayesian methods are too computationally intensive for large data sets, but are very good on small data
00:05 < jmalicki> idlework yeah, but some of the best techniques in terms of statistical power/accuracy per amount of data are simply intractable on large data
00:06 < jmalicki> idlework but in many tasks, you can outperform humans after only 100s of samples
00:06 < jmalicki> human-defined expert systems that is
00:06 < jmalicki> sorry
00:06 < ldlework> jmalicki: sure i suppose that's the bit that matters
00:06 < jmalicki> not humans making decisions
00:08 < jmalicki> idlework reinforcement learning is often used in algorithmic trading.. by algorithmic trading i'm using the finance definition, which is basically "i want to sell $1M of shares, get me the best price over the next 2 hours"
00:08 < jmalicki> since if you just put out a limit or market order
00:08 < jmalicki> you'll get fucked
00:09 < jmalicki> so you need to play poker with the market and get everyone else to bid up
00:09 < jmalicki> louipc: i feel like computers will take over any highly educated decision making jobs
00:10 < jmalicki> louipc: but highly emotionally intelligent people are coming under increasing demand
00:10 < jmalicki> louipc: even in tech in the past 10 years that has changed
00:10 < jmalicki> louipc: so for one thing, management
00:10 < jmalicki> louipc: you need to inspire people to be at their best
00:11 < jmalicki> software engineers at SF can walk and get a 50k raise easy
00:11 < jmalicki> you can't manage them with fear
00:11 < jmalicki> you need to connect your company's business needs to your employees' emotional desires
00:11 < jmalicki> and show them how they can be the person they want to be by building what you need
00:11 < jmalicki> well yeah
00:11 < jmalicki> caring about peoples' passions is a skill
00:11 < jmalicki> or feigning it
00:12 < jmalicki> and that's what gets your $2M/yr in silicon valley today
00:12 < jmalicki> that plus leetcode
00:12 < jmalicki> louipc: well yeah. they don't pay $2m/yr for it for nothing
00:13 < jmalicki> (that's the high end of a line manager, $400k is the low end)
00:17 < jmalicki> xissbburg no, these people work 35 hours/wk and have great families

00:16 < jmalicki> Can you strip at rates other than nominal?

00:30 < jmalicki> And other fixed income retirees would like the income without putting principal at risk
00:31 < jmalicki> So it separates income investment from interest rate speculation
00:34 < notmike> jmalicki: help me out here. The price of a bond is the sum of all future payments from the bond, each future period discounted by the nominal interest rate? 
00:35 < jmalicki> notmike: in theory
00:35 < jmalicki> https://m.ebrary.net/14287/economics/curve_duration_convexity
00:36 < jmalicki> Notmike make it simple
00:37 < jmalicki> Notmike let's say I want you to loan me $100 at 10% app for two years
00:37 < jmalicki> Notmike one choice is to pay you $10 in one year and $110 in two years
00:38 < jmalicki> Another is to pay you $121 in two years
00:38 < jmalicki> notmike: what happens to the market value if my interest rates move to 20% after the first year?
00:38 < jmalicki> Of each?
00:39 < jmalicki> Or say market rates, everyone pays the same, make it easy
00:41 < jmalicki> So in the first case, it would be worth $100/1.1
00:41 < jmalicki> Err no
00:41 < jmalicki> $110/1.2
00:41 < jmalicki> Since that's a 20% rate for the future $110 payment
00:42 < jmalicki> In the second it is now $121/1.2
00:42 < jmalicki> So the second case you make more money if rates go up
00:43 < jmalicki> Since the rate on the first years interest also goes up since you haven't received it
00:43 < jmalicki> That's the motivation for strips
00:43 < jmalicki> I want the second, but it doesn't exist in the market
00:44 < jmalicki> So I give the coupon to a retiree who pays me for it
00:44 < jmalicki> Who needs regular payments
00:45 < jmalicki> Notmike or as moriarty said cheaper
00:45 < jmalicki> One person buys the zero coupon for $100/1.21
00:46 < jmalicki> The retiree pays $100(1-1/1.21) for the coupon payments of $10 each year
00:46 < jmalicki> So the retiree just gets guaranteed income
00:47 < jmalicki> The fund gets interest rate speculation
00:54 < jmalicki> notmike: sorry was totes backward, zero coupon is worse when rates rise
01:00 < jmalicki> notmike: and interest rates drop during recessions because investors sell off speculative assets like say TSLA to go to safe investments like treasuries, which increases demand this pushing rates down
01:00 < jmalicki> So if a hedge fund wants to bet  on a recession, zero coupon Bond's prices will go up a lot in that case
01:01 < jmalicki> Which would increase their demand for strips
01:17 < jmalicki> ElonMusk are you Hammond?
01:17 < ElonMusk> jmalicki: I'm the CEO of Tesla Inc.
01:18 < jmalicki> apotheon: it means that a PE firm can buy Tesla and start making ICE cars instead
01:18 < apotheon> jmalicki: that too
01:52 < jmalicki> apotheon why worry about your physical embodiment?
01:52 < spynxic> jmalicki, preservation
01:52 < jmalicki> if you can upload yourself to the cloud, why would it matter?
01:52 < apotheon> jmalicki: I don't have strong enough evidence that the physical embodiment is unimportant to act on that assumption.
01:52 < jmalicki> spynxic: the body's just a vessel for the mind and soul
01:52 < jmalicki> apotheon: fair.
01:53 < spynxic> jmalicki, isn't that what you'd propose the cloud to be also
01:54 < jmalicki> apotheon: once we have VR we don't need actually cloning
01:54 < jmalicki> you just need to run a simulation of your brain in a system that interacts with other VRs
01:54 < jmalicki> apotheon: for instance, how would you know whether i have a physical embodiment?
01:55 < apotheon> jmalicki: A simulation is just a clone.  That's my point.
01:55 < jmalicki> apotheon++ need to check out egan
01:55 < jmalicki> apotheon: k
01:55 < jmalicki> thought you might be implying something more physical
01:55 < jmalicki> like if i were in a docker container i could just move between data centers
01:55 < jmalicki> no specific one would be my existence
01:56 < apotheon> jmalicki: I recommend reading Winter Market by William Gibson and Learning To Be Me by Greg Egan.  Both are relatively short, and address important ontological concerns that Cory Doctorow and Charles Stross are too flippantly unthinking to address properly.
01:56 < jmalicki> i feel like it's way easier to make uploading happen and build a datacenter on mars and transmit people's souls via radio waves than it is to put a lot of people on rockets
01:56 < jmalicki> apotheon++
01:56 < jmalicki> uploading has higher upfront fixed costs
01:56 < jmalicki> but scales to the populace
01:57 < jmalicki> and frees us from biological concerns of living in particular environments
01:57 < apotheon> jmalicki: No specific one of them would be your existence because none of them would actually have anything to do with your existence, apart from very weird ontological abstractions actually posited in some of the best singularity fiction ever written, including some by Egan -- but in the case of Egan's example of pattern-based existential philosophy, it's wildly different from the "stop worrying
01:58 < apotheon> jmalicki: Before you can transmit a soul, you have to learn to isolate a soul, and just copying data does not seem even remotely relevant to that.
01:58 < jmalicki> apotheon: oh absolutely - that's the high upfront cost to learn to do tat
02:00 < apotheon> jmalicki: Upload immortality in the style of Cory and Charles is actually creating a clone then committing suicide to let the clone become (effectively) your bodysnatcher impostor, not immortality for yourself at all.
02:00 < apotheon> jmalicki: On a scale of one to one hundred, that's Egotism: 100; Ego: 0.
02:06 < jmalicki> apotheon: why does the non-clone get elevated status of being the self?
02:06 < jmalicki> apotheon: in egan's story for instance, why is the decaying brain more self than the jewel?
02:07 < apotheon> jmalicki: because that's how Cory&&Charles imagine "immortality" working.
02:07 < apotheon> jmalicki: In Egan's story, the egg and the brain-self are shown to be distinct entities, each an individual apart from the other.
02:07 < jmalicki> as2333 nah, gs does not have the culture to do it, they will need to be disrupted, and google is regressing to the mean
02:07 < apotheon> jmalicki: Thus, letting one die while letting the other live -- whichever way it goes -- actually annihilates an individual.
02:08 < jmalicki> apotheon: yes, and why isn't the egg-self more authentic?
02:08 < jmalicki> ok fair
02:08 < as2333> jmalicki, GS owns google.
02:08 < apotheon> jmalicki: The point of Greg Egan's story, in other words, is that each of them should be the most important to itself, and one should not think of the other as "me".
02:08 < as2333> jmalicki, banking is a the topmost top of psycho-scum hierarchy.
02:09 < apotheon> jmalicki: The egg and brain entities are equally authentic individuals, but they are *distinctly* individual entities.
02:09 < jmalicki> apotheon: yeah makes sense.
02:09 < apotheon> jmalicki: Replacing either with the other actually murders someone.
02:10 < jmalicki> apotheon: but if we're thinking more abstractly than individuals, i.e. humanity sui generis
02:10 < jmalicki> and can invest in uploading vs. rockets
02:10 < jmalicki> for 3 generations from now
02:10 < jmalicki> fair
02:11 < jmalicki> apotheon: but moving people to mars can't really be made without that
02:11 < jmalicki> as it requires too much of a collective effort
02:11 < jmalicki> i just feel like it's a better bet for existence post-earth
02:12 < jmalicki> apotheon: agreed. i just think uploading is way more durable and scaleable
02:12 < jmalicki> apotheon: mars is more variable and less fixed cost by comparison
02:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: once we achieve this, we will be able to upload everyone into a hive mind of the party.
02:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: it's way easier to end individuality that way
02:13 < jmalicki> we can finally achieve the Chairman's dream.
02:14 < jmalicki> as2333 why gs and google rather than baidu?
02:14 < as2333> but jmalicki is right in that these 'technologies' are the ultimate form of totalitarianism.
02:15 < jmalicki> as2333 yeah, why bother with propaganda when you have direct control over someone's perception
02:15 < as2333> jmalicki, well only the joos are g'd chosen people. I assume g'ds plan is to extermiante yellow subhumans.
02:15 < apotheon> jmalicki: The easiest way to end individuality is to kill everyone without any of that pesky upload shit.
02:15 < as2333> jmalicki, exactly - or when you can simply delete the opposition by pressing a button.
02:16 < jmalicki> apotheon: then you lose your population. you really want a large population moving together in unison
02:16 < jmalicki> as2333 there wouldn't even be opposition
02:16 < as2333> jmalicki, right - just 'virtual' opposition that you control at will =)
02:16 < jmalicki> as2333 actually maybe there would... after all, GANs work pretty well. maybe managed opposition is a tool of authoritarianism
02:16 < jmalicki> as2333 you need just enough opposition to check your decisions
02:17 < jmalicki> as2333 but not enough to threaten you
02:18 < jmalicki> as2333 no, a good leader wants some creativity, not just yes men, from their underlings.
02:18 < jmalicki> as2333 not to help their underlings, but to extract more from their underlings
02:18 < as2333> jmalicki, but there won't be any underlings =)
02:19 < jmalicki> as2333 if the underlings believe they have more self determination than they do, this motivates them to speak up
02:19 < jmalicki> as2333 it is in the hive mind's best interest to ensure that the components believe they have free will
02:20 < jmalicki> as2333 but it still has ultimate control
02:20 < jmalicki> as2333 this is just reinforcement learning
02:20 < jmalicki> as2333 and adversarial learning
02:20 < jmalicki> the total is worth less when it truly moves in unison
02:21 < jmalicki> as2333 the amount of power the party wields.
02:21 < as2333> jmalicki, the future is a boot stamping a human face, forever.
02:21 < jmalicki> as2333 but you want *more* human faces to boot stamp, it's a delicate balance.
02:22 < jmalicki> as2333 if your goal is to boot stamp as many human faces as possible, you need to be sure the number of faces to bootstamp grows.
02:22 < jmalicki> as2333 so you want to eat your marshmallow a little later to foster some growth so you have more people to repress later
02:24 < jmalicki> as2333 but don't you think The Matrix is the ultimate goal of humanity?
02:24 < as2333> jmalicki, no I don't think so.
02:25 < jmalicki> as2333 this looks like utopia to me https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/video/hero/Movies/Top250/B000HAB4KS_thematrix_UXWB1._RI_SX940_.jpg&imgrefurl=https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Keanu-Reeves/dp/B000GJPL1S&h=646&w=940&tbnid=Ay3Oq9Q-X8RHfM&tbnh=186&tbnw=271&vet=1&docid=uNlEn0SSCuezMM
02:26 < jmalicki> apotheon: why not make it easier and just grant suffrage to disenfranchised corporate people?
02:27 < jmalicki> shouldn't all people have a right to vote?
02:28 < apotheon> jmalicki: Why should a "person" invented by law to compete with actual individuals for rights and power be able to vote?  They already effectively control election process via lobbyists.  What good is one vote for Wal-Mart when Wal-Mart can already throw enough money at politicians to equal the value of 500K votes?
02:28 < apotheon> jmalicki: . . . or do you mean something else by "corporate people" than corporations?
02:29 < jmalicki> apotheon: it saves walmart the money of having to waste money on ads and lobbyists
02:29 < jmalicki> apotheon: way less deadweight loss for the economy
02:29 < jmalicki> apotheon: the outcome is the same, why waste the song and dance?
02:29 < jmalicki> just give every shell corporation a vote
02:30 < apotheon> jmalicki: No, it doesn't.  Wal-Mart can choose to vote directly to effectively zero effect, or it can use its money to great effect.  What's the point of the vote, other than to erode individual rights just a few more centimeters?
02:30 < apotheon> jmalicki: Oh, do you mean you want to give corporations more than one vote by letting them just DDOS the electoral system's acceptance of human beings amongst its participants?
02:30 < jmalicki> apotheon: the rights of which individuals? the corporate individuals who today have no rights?
02:31 < jmalicki> apotheon: yes, the latter
02:31  * jmalicki is just being a sophist today of course
02:31 < apotheon> jmalicki: No, real individuals, real people, human beings (and maybe dolphins and octopodes, but we're still figuring that part out).
02:32 < jmalicki> notmike pedant :)
02:32 < apotheon> jmalicki: I think the shell corporation DDOS game is going to turn out to be no cheaper than lobbying.
02:33 < jmalicki> apotheon: you can mass create shell corporations for a few hundred a pop.
02:33 < apotheon> jmalicki: Yeah, sure, but you also have to maintain them and operate them for the purpose of voting, at least.
02:33 < jmalicki> apotheon: that scales easily though
02:34 < jmalicki> apotheon: an entity like goldman sachs maintains tens of thousands of them at least
02:34 < jmalicki> apotheon: offshore shell corporations are more expensive, just because there's less technology today
02:34 < jmalicki> but that will probably change
02:34 < apotheon> jmalicki: Sure, but those are used to generate or maintain profits through financial instrumentation and so on.  They're not just voters.
02:35 < apotheon> jmalicki: Are you trying to realize the "dream" of uncontrolled autonomous corporate population explosion?
02:35 < jmalicki> apotheon: yes
02:35 < jmalicki> apotheon: i'm really just being a sophist
02:35 < jmalicki> seeing where it goes
02:36 < jmalicki> apotheon: sort of like a self-driving tesla?
02:36  * jmalicki puts accelerando on my list
02:37 < jmalicki> apotheon: i dunno, i feel like following these arguments to their extreme helps to clear out what is essential
02:38 < jmalicki> suss not clear
02:39 < jmalicki> spynxic: i dunno
02:39 < jmalicki> spynxic: any state of the art AI today is composed of multiple individuals politically competing
02:39 < jmalicki> spynxic: so why would that world be different?
02:40 < jmalicki> spynxic yes
02:40 < notmike> jmalicki: apotheon can even create corporations for free in some jurisdictions
02:41 < jmalicki> notmike: like no cost paid to the state, or actually like costless as in the state provides an API>
02:41 < jmalicki> notmike: since if there's no API you have to intermediate through a third party that provides an  API and fills out the paperwork for you
02:42 < notmike> jmalicki: the paperwork is actually very easy to fill out if our goal is just to bootstrap a corporation
02:42 < jmalicki> notmike: but those costs are getting competed down quickly, legal automation is hot.
02:42 < jmalicki> notmike: if you want to bootstrap millions it's easier to outsource it
02:43 < jmalicki> apotheon: bankruptcy is murder.
02:43 < jmalicki> https://jeffreifman.com/2017/07/17/fifth-anniversary-womens-marriage-corporation/
02:43 < spynxic> jmalicki, a nation without politics implies that there are no disagreements among the participants. That is, there exists no paradoxes among the participants
02:44 < jmalicki> spynxic: but i mean, even AIs like Skynet have their internal politics and disagreements.
02:44 < apotheon> jmalicki: no
02:44 < notmike> jmalicki: yes
02:44 < jmalicki> spynxic: fundamentally they have to experiment and explore, and have different subentities that compete
02:44 < jmalicki> to improve
02:44 < apotheon> jmalicki: Entities survive bankruptcy, wether ethically significant (and thus muderable) entities like human beings or ethically insignificant (and thus non-murderable) like corporations.
02:44 < spynxic> jmalicki, politics, self centered behavior, stems from disagreement
02:45 < jmalicki> spynxic yes
02:45 < jmalicki> spynxic and modern AI technology shows that any authoritarian state should thus foster limited politics and individuality to serve its purpose
02:45 < jmalicki> spynxic: if you want to maximize the resources you can extract from your populace, you need them to be at least moderately self interested
02:46 < jmalicki> spynxic: the most profitable slaveowners knew to give a slight amount of freedom and self determination to their slaves.
02:46 < jmalicki> the profit-maximizing amount of hope
02:48 < jmalicki> apotheon: how do you figure?
02:48 < as2333> jmalicki, that is of course true, but becoming outdated and irrelevant.
02:48 < jmalicki> i have not heard that argument
02:49 < jmalicki> as2333 it is becoming more relevant in this day and age when AIs are effectively beginning to enslave people
02:49 < apotheon> jmalicki: What is a "nation", to you, in this context?
02:49 < as2333> jmalicki, because 'technology' is making political manipulation and slavery more 'efficient' and because ultimately the slaves will be exterminated since they will become a net loss for the masters.
02:49 < as2333> jmalicki, lol
02:49 < jmalicki> apotheon: a collection of people living in a place with a shared identity
02:49 < as2333> jmalicki, there are no AIs
02:50 < jmalicki> apotheon: identity as in culture, values, sense of history, etc
02:50 < apotheon> jmalicki: Oh, if that's all, then a nation doesn't say anything about governance at all.
02:50 < as2333> jmalicki, there are some non-humans like the gogle and GS owners who use computers - and cops - to enslave people.
02:50 < spynxic> jmalicki, a shared identity = a common value?
02:50 < apotheon> jmalicki: All that says is there's a group of people who have decided to differentiate themselves from other groups of people.
02:50 < apotheon> jmalicki: Of course, that still requires politics, just between nations instead of internal to them.
02:51 < jmalicki> apotheon: yeah
02:51 < jmalicki> apotheon: i mean ,there aren't universal definitions for these tings
02:51 < jmalicki> apotheon: oh, absolutely that is true.
02:52 < jmalicki> apotheon: but i tend to adhere to definitions similar to this https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog128/node/534
02:52 < jmalicki> apotheon: e.g. the Kurds are a nation is a good one
02:53 < jmalicki> apotheon: one could argue that the jewish diaspora is in some sense a nation, perhaps leading to some of the conflict historically, as they've been embedded within other nations
02:54 < apotheon> jmalicki: Nations are artifacts of conflict, so yeah.
02:55 < jmalicki> apotheon: yeah, it's the conflict that leads to the collective identity
02:56 < jmalicki> apotheon: because while we're different, conflict with others allows for identification of the collectivism of being the same vs the other
02:56 < apotheon> jmalicki: collective identity is dumb
02:57 < apotheon> jmalicki: That's my thought on that, in a nutshell.
02:57 < jmalicki> apotheon: but it exists
03:08 < jmalicki> apotheon: to be generous, collective identity is just another generalization... my collective has enforcement mechanisms for people who deviate from shared values, so if i encounter another member of the collective, i can be reasonably certain they share those values and mores, thus i can let down my guard and be more efficient in my interactions with them
03:09 < jmalicki> apotheon: like if i encounter an American with no criminal record, that is no guarantee they are not a criminal, but i can probabilistically be more trusting
03:10 < jmalicki> apotheon: this is where total surveillance has its pros and cons
03:10 < jmalicki> apotheon: with total surveillance there are no secrets, so there is no need to generalize into collective identities
03:11 < jmalicki> apotheon: thus the individual can flourish
03:11 < apotheon> jmalicki: Total surveillance cons far outweigh the pros.
03:11 < jmalicki> apotheon: perhaps, but that is why we have collective identity
03:11 < jmalicki> apotheon: if i am going to do business with you and trust that you won't steal from me
03:12 < jmalicki> apotheon: i need to know that it would be painful for you to do so
03:12 < jmalicki> apotheon: well, because the technology moves faster than the culture.
03:12 < apotheon> jmalicki: Knowing that it will be "painful" to "steal" from you is not the same as total surveillance.
03:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: agreed, it's different
03:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: it's a substitute
03:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: total surveillance allows me to know you wouldn't, you don't have to submit to an authority
03:13 < jmalicki> apotheon: but collective identity will not go away as fast as total surveillance arrives
03:13 < apotheon> jmalicki: Total surveillance gives rise to authority more absolute than could otherwise exist.
03:14 < jmalicki> apotheon: it strengthens the existing authority.
03:14 < jmalicki> apotheon: but in a nascent state absent the authority, there is no need for the authority to be created
03:15 < jmalicki> gnight
03:15 < apotheon> jmalicki: A state cannot exist without authority.
03:18 < jmalicki> apotheon: exactly, total surveillance allows for stateless anarcho-capitalism to exist
03:19 < apotheon> jmalicki: Total surveillance gives rise to authority.  It does not eliminate it.
03:20 < jmalicki> apotheon: total surveillance of all transactions is the best part of bitcoin
03:20 < apotheon> jmalicki: That's transparency, not surveillance, and it's specific to transactions conducted on the blockchain.
03:20 < as2333> jmalicki, that's why the LN comes in handy
03:21 < jmalicki> as2333 i can just refuse to touch any coin that has ever touched an anonymizer
03:21 < as2333> jmalicki, the LN is not an anonymizer
03:21 < jmalicki> i don't know enough about it
03:21 < as2333> jmalicki, but anyway, 'transparency' in bitcoin is just a flaw and hopefully it will be fixed.
03:22 < jmalicki> as2333 it's the only part not flawed
03:22 < as2333> jmalicki, and if not other systems have better builtin security
03:23 < jmalicki> as2333 that is the security to me. if you present me with coin, i have a complete picture of your identity
03:23 < as2333> jmalicki, and actually bitcoin's privacy isn't bad. Bitcoin per se doesn't fail. The problem is the cesspool known as the interweb.
03:23 < as2333> jmalicki, no you don't
03:23 < jmalicki> as2333 and can change the price i give you depending on which wallets you interacted with
03:23 < jmalicki> as2333 if you transacted with anything not transparent, i charge you a reaaaallly high price
03:23 < jmalicki> as2333 so anyone who values privacy can be crushed
03:23 < as2333> jmalicki, bullshit
03:23 < jmalicki> what do you mean bullshit?
03:24 < jmalicki> i can absolutely do that
03:24 < as2333> jmalicki, you can't really tell what's going on by looking at transactions
03:24 < jmalicki> as2333 any time i can't tell is when i fuck you over
03:24 < jmalicki> as2333 crypto is the ultimate tool of the state to crush liberty
03:25 < jmalicki> as2333 of sure, i just have to share which wallets belong to which people with other merchants to build that metadata
03:25 < jmalicki> but that will of course come to exist
03:26 < as2333> jmalicki, again, LN.
03:27 < jmalicki> as2333 again, someone using LN can be punishable by prison
03:27 < jmalicki> as2333 so, it eases control
03:27 < jmalicki> as2333 to crush liberty, yes
03:28 < jmalicki> lol
03:28 < jmalicki> so how does ln solve this?
03:30 < jmalicki> as2333 you could easily fix the lightning network by requiring that only governmentally surveilled banks can be accepted as segregated witnesses
03:30 < jmalicki> as2333 so it's still distributed
03:31 < jmalicki> we should start doing that
03:31 < jmalicki> no voting or driving etc without rfid
03:32 < as2333> jmalicki, LN allows 'peers' (that is anyone) to make off chain transactions, and to onion route transactions between peers.
03:33 < jmalicki> as2333 yeah, but i mean allowing anyone to be a peer is a bug
03:36 < jmalicki> as2333 the problem with credit cards is that i don't see all of your transactions as a merchant
03:36 < jmalicki> as2333 you still have privacy from individual merchants
03:36 < jmalicki> btc fixes that
03:37 < as2333> jmalicki, as a merchant you are not supposed to see anything
03:38 < jmalicki> as2333 with ccs i can't
03:38 < jmalicki> as2333 with btc, i can!
03:38 < jmalicki> as2333 i can then also connect your spending history with your browsing history through cookies
03:38 < jmalicki> and add that to the blockchain
03:39 < jmalicki> you can add arbitrary metadata to the blockchain
03:40 < jmalicki> as2333 but like, if you shop with me and i see you transacted with silk road, i can sell that data to advertisers
03:41 < jmalicki> as2333 wrong https://medium.com/@bkawk/inserting-metadata-into-the-blockchain-40c0734b203e
03:41 < as2333> jmalicki, you have exacrly zero proof that linked transactions correlate to linked person or the same person.
03:41 < as2333> jmalicki, you can inserty whatever garbage you want. 
03:42 < jmalicki> as2333 i can know that your browser cookie you had when you used that wallet were given at the same time
03:42 < jmalicki> as2333 were they always linked? no i don't know that
03:42 < jmalicki> as2333 just like CCs vs cookies
03:43 < jmalicki> but it means to avoid it you have to jump through hoops
03:44 < as2333> jmalicki, unless you are the government, you cant spy on people using bitcoin.
03:46 < as2333> you - jmalicki merchant - cant do it.
03:46 < jmalicki> as2333 in pre-btc days, i can spy on anyone who comes to my website, since i know every other website they visit
03:46 < jmalicki> as2333 but when they use a CC, i can't know where else they've used that CC
03:46 < jmalicki> as2333 btc solves that
03:46 < jmalicki> as2333 advertising cookies.
03:46 < jmalicki> that's the entire point of them.
03:47 < jmalicki> as2333 how do you think google makes $100B/yr ?
03:47 < jmalicki> as2333 they have spying contracts with almost all of the web
03:47 < jmalicki> as2333 they don't really make much money from that stuff
03:47 < as2333> jmalicki, it's trivially easy to not accept cookies and to not rung google's shitwre.
03:48 < jmalicki> as2333 it's through spying on your web browsing to send you targeted ads where they make the real money
03:48 < jmalicki> as2333 yes, and they've worked around that too!
03:48 < as2333> jmalicki, also you as webste owner do not get to know what other sites ppl visit at all.
03:48 < jmalicki> as2333 not through google's cookies, no. through other networks i can.
03:49 < as2333> jmalicki, again as a merchant you are just 2 inches above wage slave.
03:50 < jmalicki> as2333 for instance, when i go to amazon, they know all of the other sites in their network i visit
03:50 < jmalicki> as2333 if you use an android phone it's even better.
03:50 < jmalicki> as2333 google knows all of your movements
03:50 < jmalicki> as2333 they know what stores you visited, where you ate
03:50 < jmalicki> as2333 and can correlate that with your web visits
03:51 < jmalicki> as2333 if you use a google fit watch, they know your biometrics
03:52 < jmalicki> as2333 because google is a nice master.
03:52 < jmalicki> as2333 why value freedom if my overlord occasionally gives me a $10 coupon?
03:53 < jmalicki> ....
03:53 < jmalicki> as2333 because they've finally learned the delicate balancing act of game theory
03:53 < jmalicki> as2333 game theory didn't really exist in the trustbusting 1900s
03:53 < jmalicki> now the overlords know better
03:54 < jmalicki> as2333 google knows to tiptoe but not cross the line
03:54 < jmalicki> maybe they've finally stepped over it, dunno
03:54 < jmalicki> or maybe they're gonna give up facebook to save themselves
03:54 < jmalicki> as2333 nah, they can just throw facebook under the bus then the masses will be satisfied
03:55 < as2333> at least jmalicki is kinda playing a part....
03:55 < jmalicki> lol
03:58 < jmalicki> as2333 for instance, after all the facebook controversy google stopped actively giving you ads from your emails
03:58 < jmalicki> they still record it all and track it, they just stop letting the ads use it
03:58 < jmalicki> as2333 yes
03:58 < jmalicki> as2333 it's a short term tiny revenue hit to make sure they can still track you
03:59 < jmalicki> as2333 afaik they're not yet sending their killer robots after people who install adblockers
03:59 < jmalicki> that's probably why they started the program
04:00 < as2333> jmalicki, haha
04:00 < jmalicki> as2333 no, it's not about money, it's about total surveillance
04:01 < jmalicki> as2333 the ads are there just as a way to fund it
04:01 < jmalicki> as2333 like it takes awhile to build skynet, how can we monetize the progress?
04:01 < jmalicki> they are, the tracking is the real deal though
04:02 < jmalicki> as2333 the AI is now good enough they're beginning the weaponization portion
04:02 < jmalicki> i mean the AI isn't done
04:02 < jmalicki> but far enough along they need to begin making the drones, since that takes awhile too
04:03 < jmalicki> so in 5-10 years skynet will be at their disposable should they choose to deploy it
04:03 < notmike> jmalicki, principal Skynet
04:32 < jmalicki> wow
04:33 < jmalicki> the boards really need to push him to take a vacation and get right
04:49 < notmike> jmalicki: body modification
04:57 < jmalicki> founder omission?
07:52 < jmalicki> notmike waddya mean cryptocurrency ded? when everyone thinks its ded is when the bottom comes
07:57 < notmike> Thanks jmalicki

11:44 < jmalicki> azi`: they are on track to monopolize shopping data centers shipping advertising etc while becoming the only employer so they can pay slave wages
05:35 < jmalicki> Ethereum isn't supposed to be used as money, so it's easy to value. Money is impossible to value.
05:36 < jmalicki> Odeo shares of stock aren't supposed to be used as money, so how do you value them?
05:36 < jmalicki> Odeo houses aren't supposed to be used as money, how do you value them?
19:43 < moriarty> jmalicki, http://thereformedbroker.com/2018/09/15/delusions-and-entitlement/
21:15 < moriarty> jmalicki, don't need PE, when you can homebrew it - https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/ReplicatingPE_201512_3859877f-bd53-4d3e-99aa-6daec2a3a2d3.pdf
05:19 < jmalicki> "Here is a rough summary of how U.S. securities law works:   1. Individuals can only invest in public companies that trade on stock exchanges, publish financial statements every three months, and are generally subject to a fairly strict regime of regulation and vetting. 2. Except dentists; dentists can invest in any dumb thing someone can dream up to sell them."

05:19 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: lol
05:19 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: Dallas, or the Dalles?
05:19 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: dallas you fool
05:19 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: k.. cuz the Dalles is the datacenter capital of the world
05:20 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: yeah.. it's pretty believable, but thought to ask because it would be easy to confuse
05:21 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: I look at stuff as metro areas
05:22 < jmalicki> i would be shocked if the Dalles doesn't have more datacenter space than texas
05:22 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: cheapest power in the lower 48
05:22 < jmalicki> and a nice cool climate
05:23 < jmalicki> it matters a lot at scale
05:23 < jmalicki> no really the dalles is the cheapest in the world
05:23 < jmalicki> err lower 48
05:27 < jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: in the sf bay area
05:27 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: the difference in power is enough that amazon charges less for AWS in oregon
05:27 < jmalicki> than anywhere else
05:27 < ThriftyDillo> jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: in the sf bay area << and you don;t know how to spell Dallas?
05:27 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: yeah but amazon microoptimizes shit ridiculously
05:28 < jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: the Dalles and Dallas are completely different places
05:28 < jmalicki> ThriftyDillo: yes, that's where my bouncer is
05:28 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: because it's like their 4th one there
05:29 < jmalicki> they just keep building more
05:29 < jmalicki> but yeah, AWS is in port morrow 20 miles upstream
05:29 < jmalicki> but still the same hydroelectric power
05:30 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: hydroelectric is basically free compared to wind solar etc
05:30 < jmalicki> the dalles just has a lot of it
05:31 < jmalicki> because the columbia river has so much volume
05:31 < jmalicki> yeah occasionally
05:31 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i guess you could take advantgae of that for spot pricing :)
05:33 < jmalicki> ya
05:33 < jmalicki> iceland is super cheap too
05:33 < jmalicki> because of the geothermal power
05:33 < jmalicki> why they ship bauxite all the way to iceland just to make aluminum and ship it back
05:34 < jmalicki> the extra oil costs are nothing compared to the power cost savings
05:34 < jmalicki> if it wasn't, there would be no reason to ship to iceland
05:34 < jmalicki> yes, which is why they locate in the dalles
05:35 < jmalicki> it's a big part of their microoptimization
05:35 < jmalicki> to some degree
05:35 < jmalicki> they have to be close
05:35 < jmalicki> seattle portland and sf are all close to the dalles
05:36 < jmalicki> which is part of why
05:36 < jmalicki> why they're not in iceland
05:36 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: lol. you want to be in mahwah anyway
05:37 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: where the NYSE datacenter is
05:37 < jmalicki> lol
05:37 < jmalicki> i suppose getiting it far away is cheaper
05:38 < jmalicki> ya
05:38 < jmalicki> cool
05:39 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: does vegas have particularly good connectivity for some reason?
05:39 < jmalicki> ah
05:43 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: oh, it also is the most natural disaster free place http://www.ieee802.org/3/bs/public/14_05/ghiasi_3bs_01b_0514.pdf
05:45 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: yeah
05:46 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: well i mean it's completely rural
05:46 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: datacenters use like 95% of the power there
05:47 < jmalicki> yeah, only like the cloud datacenters bother to be in like the dalles
05:47 < jmalicki> it's in the middle of nowhere
05:47 < jmalicki> so you can't drive to it
05:50 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: it is, because like virtually everyone uses aws
05:50 < jmalicki> who uses google cloud?
05:51 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: right
05:51 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: where are you going to find people who know how to use computers?
05:52 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: no, it means you like the word cloud
05:52 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: yeah but see
05:53 < jmalicki> unless they use microservices
05:53 < jmalicki> then it takes 100s
05:54 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i'm describing the use case.
05:54 < jmalicki> you need to use microservices today. but then you spend tons of time doing json serialization and deserialization
05:54 < jmalicki> so you need a cloud to make it run
05:55 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: yeah, it's not supposed to be faster, it's supposed to be microservices on the cloud
05:55 < jmalicki> nice
05:57 < jmalicki> nice
06:01 < jmalicki> nice
06:05 < jmalicki> notmike: then they'd be like 1Gbe between routers rather than 40Gbe between routers
06:05 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: no, they'd be 100mbps
06:06 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: oh lol
06:10 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: no, only 100gbe copper https://www.cablesondemand.com/category/QSFP+100G/product/SF-NDAAFF100G-001M/URvars/Items/Library/InfoManage/.htm
06:11 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: wrong kind of copper
06:11 < jmalicki> fair :)
06:12 < jmalicki> yeah, 100gbe is very popular for hpc
06:13 < jmalicki> lots are doing 100
06:16 < jmalicki> holy fuck, 32 400gbe ports http://www.mellanox.com/page/products_dyn?product_family=280&mtag=sn3000_label
06:17 < jmalicki> yeah
06:20 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: but yeah
06:24 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i mean, you want the compute boards
06:24 < jmalicki> the entire point of wanting the 100gbe is you can't put enough cpus on a single board
06:24 < jmalicki> so you compromise through mere 100gbe
06:25 < jmalicki> oh why would you do IO? :)
06:25 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: yes, mellanox 100gbe
06:25 < jmalicki> that they market for this
06:26 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: what IO? the data is like 0.1% of the bandwitdh you're using
06:26 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: if your'e doing hpc
06:26 < jmalicki> then you get more nodes
06:26 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: yes
06:27 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: if you're writing the game you're free to make it work
06:28 < jmalicki> oh just use cuda
06:28 < jmalicki> oh right you're diablominer
06:28 < jmalicki> diablo-d3++
06:28 < jmalicki> i forgot it's been awhile :)
06:32 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: but yeah like
06:33 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: i mean hpc usually means when infiniband and not doing any IO except at boot are the right answer
06:34 < jmalicki> right.. other ways of doing it have other names
06:34 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: expensive in terms of hardware.
06:35 < jmalicki> lol yes
06:35 < jmalicki> does that even scale up much?
06:37 < jmalicki> lol
06:40 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: notmike doesnt know who I am
18:09 < jmalicki> AbleBacon: one of the most proven investment strategies out there is to short what jim cramer says to buy
19:00 < jmalicki> AbleBacon: also, crabs are not recession proof https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/recession-sinking-crab-industry-n-l-processors-say-1.803118
19:54 < jmalicki> dorei the fed still tracks them https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IR3TED01USA156N
19:55 < jmalicki> the thing about eurodollars is that because the foreign banks aren't subject to fed regulation, they can do unlimited monetary expansion unless their regulator disallows it
19:55 < jmalicki> so eurodollars can make the usd very volatile beyond the fed's control
19:56 < jmalicki> dorei no, they're the original too big to fail bank ;P
19:56 < jmalicki> they've been bailed out tons of times :)
19:57 < jmalicki> don't forget credit agricole and bnp paribas
19:57 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: more weird stuff with them too
19:59 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: also, BOA is bigger than credit agricole, and about the size of bnp paribas
19:59 < jmalicki> ya
19:59 < jmalicki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks
20:00 < jmalicki> dorei: they're not really banks in the same fashion
20:01 < dorei> jmalicki: world bank is more or less in the same fashion, they lend money with interest :p
20:02 < jmalicki> dorei: yeah, but they don't really take deposits like that... likewise central banks are also not on the list
20:03 < jmalicki> they sort of take deposits from member countries, kinda
20:03 < jmalicki> but they don't exist to be a profitable business
20:03 < jmalicki> but to provide a public service to help others make profits
20:06 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/org_nydirectors.html
20:06 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: it's not the largest banks
20:06 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: none of the largest banks are on that board
20:07 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: they do weird shit with that to hide it
20:07 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: influence always exists, the tv shows i watch influence me. they don't *control
20:07 < jmalicki> me
20:07 < jmalicki> the biggest banks don't bother with it because it doesn't gain them anything
20:08 < jmalicki> yeah, but they're not huge
20:08 < jmalicki> for a bank
20:08 < jmalicki> notmike: just like every single individual on earth
20:08 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: morgan stanley is a proxy for chase
20:10 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: chase is now owned by jp morgan which is a direct competitor to morgan stanley
20:10 < jmalicki> it is definitely not part of chase anymore
20:10 < jmalicki> the bank of morgan stanley is what used to be wachovia
20:10 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: history is not the present
20:11 < jmalicki> 4 generations later there's no secret proxy anymore
20:15 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: re gs alumni that's just because it's the best employer for most new grads
20:15 < jmalicki> so it gets the most talented people
20:15 < jmalicki> who will do other great things
20:15 < jmalicki> (a lot of) the most talented people
20:26 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: that collude when they get out 
20:26 < jmalicki> ^ see more collusion from ex-gs to cause a recession
20:27 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: talking and being friends is different from a grand conspiracy of illuminati
20:27 < jmalicki> dispersed: after they make those big gains they're gonna short btc to 0
20:28 < dispersed> jmalicki: not before they pump it?
20:29 < jmalicki> moriarty: the thesis that this is a US currency crisis is becoming increasingly believable
20:29 < jmalicki> it's looooong overdue
20:30 < notmike> jmalicki: who's going to short btc to zero when dollars are worthless?
20:30 < jmalicki> like the USD has violated conventional international finance theory for like 20 years
20:30 < moriarty> jmalicki, yeah, and if that's the case, inflation will hit soon enough
20:30 < jmalicki> yup
20:31 < jmalicki> dispersed: too soon to tell
20:31 < jmalicki> dispersed: it's never been through times like this
20:32 < jmalicki> dispersed: i'd be curious if there is data for something like btc holdings in turkey etc to help figure it out
20:40 < jmalicki> dorei the treasury does issue TIPS
20:41 < jmalicki> moriarty: oh wow, that's the first i've heard of us treas foreign denominated debt
20:41 < jmalicki> trying to figure out like, when they did that?
20:42 < moriarty> jmalicki, it's nothing compared to domestic
20:42 < jmalicki> moriarty: yeah, 5% isn't *nothing*
20:42 < jmalicki> moriarty: i've just never even heard of it before
20:43 < jmalicki> moriarty: trying to like find what programs exist etc
20:44 < jmalicki> moriarty: i can't even google it.....
20:46  * jmalicki is deeply disturbed that i can't find details
21:53 < jmalicki> moriarty: hmm you don't think weed is a bubble?
21:53 < jmalicki> like it seems priced pretty high
21:53 < jmalicki> but that's why i do the quant stuff, i don't get investing in irrational exhuberance
21:54 < plaerzen> I agree with jmalicki, I've sold most of my acb stocks.  I think we'll see another good time to buy in the coming months though.  Also brent is at 86.29..... dunno where mrfinance is getting his .oil from
21:54 < moriarty> jmalicki, bubbles are only defined in hindsight
21:55 < moriarty> jmalicki, for a growth stock, there's nothing a quant would be able to say anything as to their valuations
21:56 < moriarty> jmalicki, like how would you value a company whose value is mostly baked into the future, no pun intended :D
21:56 < jmalicki> moriarty: well, if you have reasonably justified estimates of future earnings from someone else
21:57 < jmalicki> if you have a narrative, a quant can put a value on the narrative
21:57 < jmalicki> i can't see a narrative that justifies current weed stock prices?
21:57 < jmalicki> oh i know
21:57 < jmalicki> the narrative is what's important
21:57 < jmalicki> the quant is easy by comparison
21:57 < jmalicki> but like
21:58 < plaerzen> jmalicki: the canadian weed market is like 4-6 bil retail, tops.  The big value comes from global markets - which none exist (or very few do), yet.  But once USA legalizes federally (when?), it will be gold rush days.
21:58 < jmalicki> sell to the greater fool is a narrative i just can't do well
21:58 < jmalicki> moriarty: that's what i'm saying, it's something i just don't get
21:58 < moriarty> jmalicki, we've had this discussion before
21:59 < jmalicki> if that's what you do well more power to you
21:59 < jmalicki> it is completely alien to me
22:02 < moriarty> jmalicki, at the end of the day, value is what a buyer is willing to pay a seller, no more, no less
22:06 < jmalicki> moriarty: yep
22:07 < jmalicki> moriarty: but it also comes to your skillset as well
22:07 < jmalicki> predicting the madness of crowds is not something that i can do well
22:08 < jmalicki> yep :)
22:08 < jmalicki> that's why limited liability exists
22:08 < jmalicki> lol
22:09 < jmalicki> they had ridiculously high leverage to begin with
22:09 < jmalicki> for ltcm a bigger danger was being a whale
22:09 < jmalicki> when they fucked up, sharks smelled blood in the water
22:09 < jmalicki> it would not have been so disastrous  had they been a small firm
22:10 < jmalicki> like if they had been alone in the bet as a small firm
22:10 < moriarty> jmalicki, the company was worth $4 billion at the peak, and when they tanked, the bulge brackets and big banks offered a grand sum of $250m
22:10 < jmalicki> moriarty: they still did well.
22:12 < moriarty> jmalicki, guess which banks declined to participate :P
22:12 < jmalicki> moriarty: loool
22:13 < jmalicki> i mean, yes, they drank the koolaid
22:13 < jmalicki> but so did they people who bought btc at $18k
22:13 < moriarty> jmalicki, lol, i think bitcoin is an issue of scaling
22:14 < jmalicki> well, in a lot of ways so was ltcm
22:14 < jmalicki> they scaled to the point their positions were not liquid
22:14 < jmalicki> and they could not cleanly exit
22:14 < jmalicki> moriarty: hmm i've heard good things about coinbase
22:15 < jmalicki> i mean they've struggled to scale
22:15 < jmalicki> but anyone growing that fast has issues
22:15 < jmalicki> for a time
22:16 < jmalicki> hammond: yup, index funds is where it's at
22:29 < jmalicki> moriarty: more bad quant stuff https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/quant-investor-cliff-asness-hasn-t-smashed-his-screen-this-year-yet
22:30 < jmalicki> doing long-term quant is sort of misunderstanding where that is today
22:30 < jmalicki> like, noone would ask siri "which career should i choose given who i am"
22:30 < jmalicki> and do that
22:31 < jmalicki> but siri can do a lot of crappy research quickly and do better than you in 5 minutes
22:31 < plaerzen> jmalicki: I think you maybe over-estimate people.  If people go on reddit to ask what career they should do......
22:31 < jmalicki> plaerzen: well, it's getting evidence
22:31 < jmalicki> not a final decision
22:32 < jmalicki> moriarty: tons of people are figuring out how to make millions in the tech bubble before it collapses
22:32 < jmalicki> no need for it to be a long career if you make the right decisions
22:32 < jmalicki> like, just read blind
22:32 < jmalicki> moriarty: it's cool if you're down being a postdoc till you're 50
22:33 < jmalicki> whenever i have like almost tenure at a job and i feel myself slowing down i feel like i need to quit
22:33 < jmalicki> i can't do that shit
22:33 < jmalicki> if i had the willpower to rest and vest i'd be way better off today
22:34 < jmalicki> i don't mind the slog
22:34 < jmalicki> i hate the guilt of being paid more to do less
22:34 < jmalicki> and that like, everyone is cool with that, wtf
22:35 < jmalicki> plaerzen: i feel like a lot of that is health related
22:35 < jmalicki> at least for me in the last 5 years, i discovered taking care of myself better restored a lot of that
22:36 < plaerzen> jmalicki: Yeah I can see that.  I do need to take better care of my health.  But also..... ... you get beat down a lot in your 20s, in you're 30's you're like "fuck it all then"
22:37 < jmalicki> plaerzen: yeah
22:37 < jmalicki> lol
22:38 < jmalicki> seeing people watch twitch at work is just like... infuriating to me
22:38 < jmalicki> plaerzen: i mean, there are companies that care more
22:38 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: man you'd hate me
22:39 < plaerzen> jmalicki: oh for sure, I'm glad I work at a good one now.
22:39 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: quite possibly ;P
22:39 < jmalicki> plaerzen: cool
22:40  * jmalicki can't wait til tomorrow so i can have chicken liver ice cream
22:40 < jmalicki> plaerzen: yes! https://saltandstraw.com/flavor/draculas-blood-pudding/
22:40 < jmalicki> special halloween flavor
22:41 < jmalicki> lol
22:46 < jmalicki> plaerzen: you should use it to sing "i'm too sexy" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wmqq3TfV5w
22:46 < Diablo-D3> jmalicki: NO
22:46 < plaerzen> jmalicki: lol I totally could
22:54 < jmalicki> Diablo-D3: he is quite the artist! https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/george-w-bush-paintings/index.html
22:59 < jmalicki> moriarty: ah yeah... inventories fuck up gdp
23:00 < moriarty> jmalicki, i've been pretty impressed by how Trump has managed the economy thus far
23:10 < jmalicki> moriarty: yeah, lowering the corporate tax rate is something that needed to be done for a long time
23:10 < jmalicki> the trade war definitely helps inequality, but not convinced it's otherwise a longterm net win
23:12 < moriarty> jmalicki, indeed, probably a talking point with china to rebalance the trade terms, not a longterm thing
23:17 < jmalicki> budfox yeah happens everywhere, just like the muslim immigrants who make america and europe a success are subject to racism there.
23:19 < budfox> jmalicki: muslim immigrants are making more damage to europe than to the u.s.
23:19 < jmalicki> budfox and more success!
23:19 < jmalicki> tryphe_: oh there is news, but everything is horrible in china
23:19 < jmalicki> it gets lost
23:20 < jmalicki> Uyghur food is really good too
23:20 < jmalicki> i love lagman
23:21 < jmalicki> budfox: a lot of the ones moving to europe are the ones who want to escape that, who have rejected it.
23:23 < budfox> jmalicki: yeah. but what they've rejected are more related to their countries and governments
23:25 < jmalicki> tryphe_: what did the CCP put in the nyt?
23:27 < tryphe_> jmalicki, pick up any issue, it's there in fine print
23:28 < tryphe_> jmalicki, wall street journal, new york times, there's full page spreads sponsored by the government, which is controlled by the ccp
23:29 < jmalicki> ummm
23:30 < jmalicki> mats trump has become mroe aggressive on that
23:36 < jmalicki> budfox: or new zealand, that banned foreign ownership of real estate cuz so many foreign preppers were buying property there
23:37 < budfox> jmalicki: hehe i can imagine new zealand being a target for foreign property buyers
21:17 < dispersed> BTW, where is jmalicki? He used to be here all the time, but when crypto seemed to crash with stocks, he just quit... was he a weak hand :)?
03:19 < jmalicki> much invested investment capital
03:19 < jmalicki> moriarty: it's more fixed cost
03:19 < jmalicki> you don't need money in your brokerage
03:19 < jmalicki> you need money in your server room
03:19 < jmalicki> and your staff
03:19 < jmalicki> the returns on your brokerage look huge
03:19 < jmalicki> the costs are elsewhere
03:20 < jmalicki> moriarty: yeah but when you're smaller, you just take the best trades so you  don't need that
03:20 < jmalicki> and take the crappier ones when you're big enough to negotiate the rates
03:22 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: you just need to know people with money who like you
03:23 < jmalicki> fidelity is better than IB if you're bigger
03:23 < hammond> jmalicki: so 52 intraday huh
03:23 < jmalicki> and don't need automated
03:23 < jmalicki> hammond: most successful hedge funds win like 52% of the time
03:23 < jmalicki> they're not always right
03:23 < jmalicki> they're just right more often than wrong
03:24 < jmalicki> which is a ton of extra research
03:24 < jmalicki> and work
03:25 < jmalicki> hammond: the way intraday traders do it is they make money 90% or 95% of days
03:25 < jmalicki> but not 90% of trades
03:26 < jmalicki> hammond: here is some actual data https://inalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/Inalytics-Research-Paper-03-Track-Records-Luck-or-Judgement.pdf
03:27 < jmalicki> hammond: http://www.northinfo.com/documents/238.pdf
03:27 < jmalicki> or if you don't scale up, you have some good years and bad years
03:27 < jmalicki> and you're not consistent
03:28 < jmalicki> and you cant' tell if you're just being unlucky, or if your strategy stopped working
03:28 < jmalicki> hammond: for high growth stocks, the hit rate is more like 10%
03:28 < jmalicki> hammond: 90% go bankrupt, 10% make you 100x
03:29 < jmalicki> err 5% you break even, 4% you double, 1% you 100x
03:29 < jmalicki> so you can't even really backtest that
03:29 < jmalicki> you just have to have a gut feeling
03:29 < jmalicki> yeah
03:30 < hammond> jmalicki: why, it was obvs trending upwards.
03:30 < jmalicki> hammond: so was FB
03:30 < jmalicki> it's trending upwards till it isn't
03:30 < jmalicki> most backtests fail to even have correct stock prices or dividend info
03:31 < jmalicki> data is shitty as fuck
03:31 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: it means they're doing a linear regression rather than an MA(3)
03:32 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: pardon me sir? backtesting or algorithms?
03:32 < jmalicki> moriarty: fills and gap downs are waaay less of a problem if you're tiny
03:32 < hammond> jmalicki: tsla was trending up, my bot was buying and selling so obvs I had 52% rate. 
03:33 < jmalicki> hammond: so if you're worried about bear markets, you just need two bots, one for bull and bear, and a third bot to decide which you're in
03:33 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: these bots, you pros make yourselves right?
03:34 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you don't have huge needs you can script like elitetrader or quantopian or something
03:34 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: thanks let me google that
03:34 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: define huge needs though.. i'm gonna ask for a large investment
03:34 < jmalicki> notmike: is gekko yours?
03:35 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: like how much processing do you need to do per quote, on what timescale, on what number of symbols
03:35 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you're doing like 10 symbols and applying a couple of rules once a minute, quantopian is fine
03:36 < jmalicki> moriarty: umm so you're saying there are 5 million people in mensa?
03:36 < jmalicki> err the world?
03:36 < jmalicki> it's more like most of the top 2% don't care to be in mensa
03:37 < jmalicki> hammond: you want like a portfolio of 52% or 51% is ideal
03:37 < jmalicki> hammond: if you find 10 52%, you're pretty good
03:37 < moriarty> jmalicki, well, not everyone who are smart necessarily wants to join Mensa
03:37 < jmalicki> moriarty: there are 6 billion in the world, top 2% is obviously 120 million
03:37 < moriarty> jmalicki, but their IQ cutoff suggests it's at the top 2% percentile
03:37 < hammond> jmalicki: now you are saying I need to find some stocks that are condusive to 52%.
03:37 < moriarty> jmalicki, sure, if everyone bothered to try for Mensa
03:38 < moriarty> jmalicki, i know plenty of people who don't care about Mensa
03:38 < jmalicki> hammond: if you find 10 52% strategies you're in business
03:38 < jmalicki> moriarty: if you don't make MENSA there's always the International High IQ Society
03:38 < moriarty> jmalicki, yeah, or some honour society
03:38 < hammond> jmalicki: I will put it to the test.
03:38 < jmalicki> lol
03:39 < jmalicki> or who's who
03:39 < hammond> jmalicki: do you work for a hedgefund?
03:40 < jmalicki> hammond: did at one point
03:40 < jmalicki> coding my bot
03:41 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: you need any financing for your bot coding? :D
03:41 < jmalicki> hammond: the key is in numbers.  plot the confidence intervals for a Binomial(100, .52) Binomial(1000, .52) etc
03:41 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: no
03:41 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: what language is it best to code bots in?
03:41 < jmalicki> hammond: if you have enough trades at 52%, you're usually in the black
03:42 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: depends what you're doing. python, OCaml, C++, VHDL if you're really serious
03:42 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: VHDL
03:42 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: i think ill go for javascript seeing as how Lisk is soon about to be released
03:42 < jmalicki> EconoDillo: OH MY GOD i saw them actually administering a Mark V E-Meter test on the street yesterday
03:42 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: yeah, you want to integrate your bot with a FIX engine and ethernet core
03:42 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: for faster trading
03:43 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: so when you colocate it at the 
03:43 < jmalicki> NYSE you don't have to worry about the dog-slow PCI-e bus
03:43 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: http://www.wallstreetfpga.com/fix-on-an-fpga/
03:44 < EconoDillo> jmalicki - Bowfinger - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131325/ << Eddie Murphy is a member of an organization called Mind Head (a parody of Scientology).  Very funny movie
03:44 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: how can i repa u man
03:44 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: getting it all to work
03:44 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: then you need atomic clocks in NY and Chicago
03:45 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: and a network of satellites for faster communication, since the distance is longer, but fiber optics on earth has a high refractive index so is thus slower
03:45 < jmalicki> light is faster in a vacuum then over fiber
03:45 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: it's really simple, not much to it
03:46 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: thanks man. matter of fact im gonna make y'all a song right now. you'll probably not click it but
03:47 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: https://gizadeathstar.com/2016/07/latest-twist-hfthigh-frequency-trading-atomic-clocks/
03:47 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: much obliged!
03:47 < jmalicki> https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/private-microwave-networks-financial-hft/
03:49 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: and you need to rack your bot here https://www.equinix.com/locations/united-states-colocation/new-york-data-centers/ny4/
03:49 < jmalicki> xau yes
03:50 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: gotcha, cheers bud
03:51 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: so it has to be in NY right?
03:51 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: currently hosting a few sites on www.vultr.com which is i think... one of the very few ones to offer OpenBSD as an OS. i'm never running linux again...
03:52 < PeteHansen> ill leave after this to make a beat for jmalicki while i digest his advice, but yeah:
03:56 < jmalicki> lol
03:56 < jmalicki> xau lots of short term swings in a crashing market
03:56 < jmalicki> xau learn to recognize the tops and bottoms
03:58 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: in case you need help digesting https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Lubes-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant/dp/B005MR3IVO?th=1
03:59 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: ha
04:00 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: alright you want lube ill put a lube sample in my thank you song (which is starting to sound kinda nice actually)
04:02 < jmalicki> moriarty++ the teacups link is really good
04:02 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: try r/wallstbets
04:02 < moriarty> jmalicki, yeah i quite like it too :)
04:06 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: have you considered being the first ICO closed-end hedge fund?
04:07 < jmalicki> oh, make that 2nd at least
04:09 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: cool, at least someones already paved the way for me then
04:11 < PeteHansen> jmalicki is being suspiciously nice to me..
04:12 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: i just wanna see you write a VHDL trading bot
04:13 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: i know this guy from finland
04:14 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: https://www.financial-hacker.com/hacking-hft-systems/
04:20 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: lemme know before u leave yeah?
04:20 < jmalicki> know what
04:42 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: mind if i ask what your favorite type of music is?
04:43 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: depends on my mood, but i tend to listen to a lot of indie techno pop as my default
04:44 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: could you point me to any rare old classics? ill see if i cant work it in. by doing this im also proving to you i can make a vhdl bot. its like they say "if you're good to dance, you're also good in bed"
04:44 < jmalicki> ummm
04:45 < jmalicki> i'm not having sex with you.
04:46 < jmalicki> sylvan esso die young
04:48 < PeteHansen> jmalicki, sweetie, kontiki, e.t., beefy
04:48 < jmalicki> wazzat
04:50 < PeteHansen> jmalicki preaching the numbers game like an e.t., pockets fat and beefy
04:50 < jmalicki> lol
05:04 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: nice song but there are no parts of it that go solo for me to sample
05:19 < PeteHansen> the exact same stuff im doing with jmalicki's now 3 beats, except for video
05:31 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: so ur gonna hear my weak voice with a norwegian accent on top of some jazz-like flying lotus/earl sweatshirt type stuff
06:27 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: last question i promise. you have a favorite slow song with no drums?
07:23 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: im finally done!
07:27 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: https://soundcloud.com/hemmeligkonto2/jmaliki
09:45 < PeteHansen> damn jmalicki gave some good advice yesterday
21:05 < PeteAFK> jmalicki: Thanks again for yesterday that stuff was priceless
21:05 < PeteAFK> jmalicki: Thanks again for yesterday that stuff was priceless
21:17 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: You around?
21:27 < PeteHansen> hammond: who were the top dogs here other than moriarty, jmalicki and jeffree?
21:30 < PeteHansen> i was told by jmalicki 
21:36 < PeteHansen> here it is jmalicki do you read me? https://soundcloud.com/hemmeligkonto/sets/econometrics-thank-you-note
21:37 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: https://soundcloud.com/hemmeligkonto/sets/econometrics-thank-you-note/s-ZUzzp
22:39 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: you realize a lot of that information isn't exactly... practical right?
22:40  * notmike forces jmalicki into an arbitration agreement
22:40 < jmalicki> lol
22:41 < jmalicki> apparently FB knows the data stealing jig is up, and is now investing big into blockchain
22:41 < jmalicki> so it can centralize the blockchain and do to people's finances what it did by centralized the web and doing to peoples' privacy
22:42 < marginal_> smh jmalicki
22:43 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: no i did not realize that, was planning to sift through it all now
22:44 < jmalicki> e.g. "i'm thinking about building an ecommerce site" -> get a few billion in funding, a worldwide network of data centers, a payment network, a search engine, hundreds of warehouses, 500k employees
22:45 < jmalicki> but then again it might be practical
22:45 < jmalicki> since building an ecommerce bookstore today without that can be tough
22:46 < jmalicki> since like, that's what you're up against
22:46 < jmalicki> so you have to have some sort of advantage to overcome all those disadvantages at the beginning
22:47 < jmalicki> and slowly fix them
22:47 < jmalicki> but people *constantly* build successful niche ecommerce sites
22:47 < jmalicki> you just can't compete with amazon head-on
22:48 < jmalicki> you have to be doing something unique, ideally something not worth it for them to bother with
22:48 < jmalicki> there are businesses that amazon would consider complete failures that could absolutely transform the life of someone smaller
22:49 < jmalicki> but if your strategy is to write a bot to swing trade SPY... good fucking luck
22:50 < jmalicki> like if you do crypto, smaller cryptos might actually have more opportunity
22:52 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: large liquid securities with really high volume are swamped with well funded players managing tens of billions with staffs of hundreds of the best people
22:52 < jmalicki> you don't want to play in that
22:52 < PeteHansen> i can just do /lastlog jmalicki
22:52 < jmalicki> lol
22:56 < jmalicki> notmike you're not going to Vegas to see Noam Chomsky's Hegemony of Wonder?
22:56 < jmalicki> https://entertainment.theonion.com/noam-chomsky-announces-las-vegas-residency-1819578692
22:57 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: bitcoin is the topic
22:58 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: lol certainly hasn't been for the past couple of hours
23:00 < jmalicki> apotheon: there are some people who do problematic "i'm not touching you, i'm not touching you, i'm not touching you" type games with words
23:00 < jmalicki> and that does get pretty fucking annoying
23:00 < apotheon> jmalicki: Can you give me an example of what you mean?
23:00 < jmalicki> like no, that does deserve a punch in the face back
23:01 < jmalicki> apotheon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54
23:01 < apotheon> jmalicki: Oh, you mean coming right up to the line off legitimate offense, but not stepping over?
23:01 < jmalicki> apotheon: yeah, in a deliberately hostile way
23:01 < notmike> jmalicki: even these companies spending millions into blockchain have no idea how they're going to use it to improve their products
23:03 < jmalicki> dispersed: in real life, nonverbal communication is huge
23:03 < jmalicki> that is lost via email
23:03 < dispersed> jmalicki: that's my point
23:04 < jmalicki> apotheon: it is problematic, but a lot of charitable vs hostile type communications can be cleared up with a facial expression
23:04 < jmalicki> dispersed: quite possibly, we're just highly evolved to use it
23:05 < apotheon> jmalicki: A lot of charitable vs. hostile communication can be obfuscated or manipulated via facial expression, too -- or wildly misunderstood by facial expression.
23:07 < jmalicki> apotheon: true
23:09 < jmalicki> apotheon: yeah... you have to learn to be quite more precise for online communication
23:09 < jmalicki> since the reader does not have additional supporting evidence
23:15 < jmalicki> apotheon: there's actually a company that exists purely for that purpose
23:16 < jmalicki> apotheon: ugh can't find the link
23:16 < jmalicki> i don't know how to google for it
23:17 < apotheon> jmalicki: There are companies in Japan that exist to fill in for you when getting berated by a manager, visiting a daughter when the other parent has custody, and so on.
23:18 < jmalicki> lol
23:40 < jmalicki> looool "In 2015, CBS News reported that some plastic surgeons were using plastic surgery to help women with RBF."
23:40 < jmalicki> apotheon: i find that offensive
23:41 < jmalicki> apotheon: what makes you sure they were offended?
23:41 < jmalicki> apotheon: or are you just assuming it becausey ou don't see them smiling?
23:42 < apotheon> jmalicki: I guess I'm not sure, but the "stfu bitch" and following acrimoniously flagged statements seem like strong evidence.
23:42 < jmalicki> apotheon: maybe they were laughing and lightly punching you on the shoulder in real life
23:43 < apotheon> jmalicki: If smiling, I'd count the smile as evidence of something, but given the actual words used it really seemed like a smile would be misleading rather than clarifying.
00:44 < jmalicki> lol
00:44 < jmalicki> hammond: because the markets just closed and he wrapped up his trading postmortem? :)
00:46 < blablaa> jmalicki, what happened with your trading bot?
00:46 < blablaa> jmalicki, is it trading? :P
00:47 < hammond> jmalicki: why are you taking so long to code urs, blablaa is kinda right.
00:48 < jmalicki> blablaa unfinished
00:49 < jmalicki> hammond: because i've basically been working at 25% for awhile until recently
00:49 < blablaa> jmalicki, do you want help at finishing it? source code sharing, half the profit for each.
00:50 < jmalicki> blablaa that's too complicated for now
00:50 < jmalicki> like the work to finish is less than the legal work to make that happen
00:50 < hammond> jmalicki: if ur trading short term it can't take that long to create strats 
00:50 < jmalicki> hammond: it's creating the system
00:50 < blablaa> jmalicki, i said, we can skip the legal work by simply sharing the code
00:50 < blablaa> jmalicki, i'll use the bot with my own money, you use it with your
00:50 < hammond> jmalicki: linking to IB?
00:51 < jmalicki> blablaa it has limited capacity
00:51 < jmalicki> hammond: no, getting a system that can watch all trades on the market and score them with relatively low latency
00:52 < hammond> jmalicki: in python?
00:52 < jmalicki> for v1 i'm using scala... python is a bbit slow for that
00:52 < jmalicki> and sucks at concurrency
00:52 < jmalicki> scala ain't the fastest but it's a middle ground
00:52 < jmalicki> that is acceptable
00:53 < jmalicki> python doesn't do threads, and any ipc mechanisms are pretty slow
00:53 < jmalicki> since typically you have ser/deser
00:53 < hammond> jmalicki: I see. that is kinda crazy. 
00:53 < jmalicki> and python is usually 10-30x slower
00:53 < jmalicki> hammond: i mean it "has" threads
00:53 < jmalicki> hammond: but it has the GIL, so only one thread can run at once
00:53 < jmalicki> which kind of... defeats the point
00:54 < jmalicki> python is GREAT at prototyping
00:54 < jmalicki> and for gtd
00:54 < jmalicki> but execution wise meh
00:54 < jmalicki> hammond: my initial POC that could only backtest was all python and sql
00:55 < jmalicki> hammond: processing all market data one one cpu where you kinda care about latency sucks
00:55 < hammond> jmalicki: so you need to trade a lot faster to get good results? or what
00:56 < jmalicki> hammond: yes, since good trades are sparse
00:56 < jmalicki> hammond: so i have to watch basically the entire market
00:56 < hammond> jmalicki: ok
00:56 < jmalicki> hammond: it is mostly sitting and waiting
00:56 < jmalicki> watching for opportunity
00:56 < blablaa> jmalicki, technical analysis opportunity?
00:56 < hammond> jmalicki: you know you need atleast 25K in IB to do short sells right?
00:56 < jmalicki> there are usually about maybe 100 good trades on at once across the entire market
00:57 < jmalicki> hammond: yup
00:57 < blablaa> jmalicki, or you also do inter-asset bets?
00:57 < jmalicki> blablaa: sort of technical analysis
00:57 < jmalicki> blablaa: sniping
00:57 < blablaa> jmalicki, you do also trade with multiple assets? it's really complicated then...
00:57 < jmalicki> blablaa: not in a single trade
00:57 < jmalicki> they're all distinct
00:58 < jmalicki> blablaa: but it is trading basically all US equities, that meet some liquidity criteria
00:58 < hammond> jmalicki: but how are you even sure you will get filled when you detect a chance?
00:58 < jmalicki> hammond: because i'm trying to fill like 100 shares
00:58 < jmalicki> varies
00:59 < jmalicki> hammond: in between
00:59 < jmalicki> ranginv across those orders of magnitude
01:00 < jmalicki> hammond: i'm using limit orders out of *caution*, but not trying to get a great price, just not trying to get fucked
01:00 < jmalicki> hammond: like making limit orders that deliberately cross the market
01:00 < jmalicki> hammond: possible, but that is also illegal for the broker
01:00 < jmalicki> hammond: whoever else that does not have inside info?
01:01 < jmalicki> hammond: well, that's *what the bot is trying to do to other people*
01:01 < jmalicki> so they probably would have already been doing it if they could
01:02 < jmalicki> hammond: nothing is ever certain until it's in the past.
01:02 < jmalicki> of course there are ways it can go wrong
01:02 < jmalicki> w/o guesswork it would be irrational to ever get out of bed
01:03 < jmalicki> "what if a drunk driver hits me when i'm crossing the street?"
01:03 < jmalicki> well like, that's a risk i take every day.
01:03 < hammond> jmalicki: okay.
01:04 < jmalicki> hammond: but i am proceeding because i have basically done all of the contingency checking i can possibly do without launching it
01:05 < jmalicki> hammond:  i have made a lot of worst case assumptions about fills etc
01:05 < jmalicki> hammond: slippage etc
01:05 < jmalicki> i don't know for certain it's worst case.
01:05 < jmalicki> but i'm trying to assume i get fucked a little bit
01:06 < jmalicki> hammond: shrug, then it doesn't trade.
01:06 < as2333_> jmalicki,  you should watch out for cars before crossing a street. That's not 'guesswork'.
01:06 < jmalicki> hammond: that's primarily an issue for people who are trying to get a good price on limit orders and make the bbid ask bounce
01:06 < jmalicki> hammond: right now, i'm assuming i get the worst fill in the next minute.
01:06 < jmalicki> hammond: not a random fill, the *worst* fill
01:07 < jmalicki> and assuming i lose a bit *on top* of that
01:07 < jmalicki> hammond: then you don't get out of bed.
01:07 < jmalicki> hammond: like i said, i have done all of the analysis possible without going live.
01:08 < jmalicki> hammond: since you never know for sure what happens until you put your orders in the market.
01:08 < jmalicki> hammond: so obviously, that is the  next step, to build it so it can trade
01:08 < jmalicki> and then analyze that
01:08 < hammond> jmalicki: look if your success rate is dependant on fill time then you should make certain you include the assumption where nothing gets filled.
01:08 < jmalicki> hammond: but at some point, you need to make the bet "is it worth it to do this really expensive step to get more data?"
01:09 < jmalicki> hammond: then it won't trade
01:09 < jmalicki> *shrug*
01:09 < jmalicki> sure it can happen
01:10 < jmalicki> hammond: what if a market order for 100 shares doesn't get filled?
01:10 < jmalicki> if a market order for 100 shares of aapl doesn't fill
01:10 < jmalicki> you have bigger problems
01:11 < jmalicki> hammond: that's like "what if tomorrow there is global thermonuclear warfare"
01:11 < jmalicki> hammond: sure.
01:11 < jmalicki> hammond: but you try it, then analyze
01:11 < jmalicki> hammond: yes, that's why you stop analyzing and find out what happens for real
01:12 < jmalicki> hammond: and then once it's out there, you can analyze and correct
01:12 < jmalicki> hammond: like compare predicted to actual fills, predicted to actual fill time etc.
01:12 < jmalicki> and get better assumptions
01:13 < jmalicki> by observing what actually happens when you stick your neck out
01:13 < jmalicki> hammond: writing the trading system is being agile
01:13 < jmalicki> hammond: you have to put it in front of users and see the results
01:13 < jmalicki> not spend months analyzing what you want to write
01:13 < jmalicki> but get it out there
01:14 < jmalicki> hammond: you're almost inverting the agile manifesto
01:14 < blablaa> jmalicki, i believe your approach is correct btw
01:14 < jmalicki> hammond: agile says, don't analyze or prepare, create and put it in front of a user.
01:14 < jmalicki> sure it can go wrong
01:14 < jmalicki> which is why you stop thinking about what can go wrong, and create and see what happens
01:14 < hammond> but jmalicki u know best.
01:14 < jmalicki> hammond: exactly, i am doing the minimum
01:15 < jmalicki> hammond: it's just that the minimum is still a lot of work
01:15 < jmalicki> hammond: did that manually a few times
01:16 < jmalicki> hammond: but not enough trades to matter
01:16 < jmalicki> hammond: the average security has like a 2% chance of being traded
01:16 < jmalicki> in a whole day
01:16 < jmalicki> but i've done some minimal testing
01:16 < jmalicki> hammond: it is too sparse, just not possible
01:17 < jmalicki> hammond: no point in writing a minimal system that never trades
01:18 < jmalicki> like 10 data points a week
01:18 < jmalicki> hammond: i am satisfied with my approach
01:18 < jmalicki> hammond: i am satisfied with my approach
01:18 < jmalicki> yep it can go wrong
01:18 < jmalicki> instead of thinking about it i'm shutting up and writing it
01:19 < jmalicki> i will be right or wrong
01:19 < jmalicki> time will tell
01:19 < jmalicki> no point in arguing about the future
01:20 < jmalicki> but i have seen enough evidence to satisfy me that it will either work as is, or with some correction to actual observed patterns
01:20 < jmalicki> *shrug*
01:20 < jmalicki> hammond: instead of arguing with me, you could be building a trading system :)
01:20 < notmike> wow dude jmalicki gets it
01:20 < notmike> jmalicki++
01:20 < jmalicki> thx
01:21 < jmalicki> hammond: when i fall flat on my face, i will tell you what my mistakes were
01:26 < jmalicki> hammond: i am only looking at trades where i would trade at a small fraction of the 1min volume
01:26 < jmalicki> in expectation
01:26 < jmalicki> hammond: i do have a forward looking volume prediction model
01:26 < jmalicki> and completely exclude securities where it's so unlikely to be enough liquidity to bother
01:27 < jmalicki> i'm not looking for fills where no actual trades are happening
01:28 < jmalicki> for now, at least
01:29 < jmalicki> hammond: but assuming you only get a fill for a few percent of volume, at even worse than the worst actual fill, etc. is as conservative as you can get without being nassim taleb burying your head in the sand and losing all your money betting on black swans
01:30 < jmalicki> from there, you can measure what actually happens when you do it
01:31 < jmalicki> hammond: i am much more concerned about what an additional trade does to the path of the security
01:39 < jmalicki> .bonds
01:52 < jmalicki> hammond: but on a larger note, you do have to know what your *minimum* viable product is
01:52 < jmalicki> hammond: e.g. if you want to invade afghanistan, it might be a team of highly trained navy seals on horseback
01:52 < jmalicki> hammond: a guy walking across the border with a .22 isn't going to give you any useful data
01:54 < jmalicki> notmike: fair enough, i'm just referring to history
01:54 < jmalicki> notmike++
01:55 < jmalicki> notmike: well i mean, i feel like hammond is advocating for being even *more* reckless
01:55 < jmalicki> notmike: like there is some minimum at which there is just no hope
01:56 < jmalicki> notmike: i'm saying i at least need to be as prepared as they were in that event
01:56 < jmalicki> because being *even more* reckless is just pointless
01:56 < jmalicki> like, my MVP does not involve colocating in the NYSE
01:56 < jmalicki> even though everyone knows you have to do that
01:56 < jmalicki> my MVP does not involve atomic clocks
01:56 < jmalicki> even though everyone knows you have to do that
01:58 < mythomaniac> sup jmalicki 
01:58 < jmalicki> sup
01:58 < jmalicki> writing unit tests
01:58 < jmalicki> fixing race conditions
02:00 < jmalicki> i mean you can't be completely reckless
02:00 < jmalicki> some people underprepare and flail
02:00 < jmalicki> there is an approximate right amount of certainty
02:00 < jmalicki> yeah
02:01 < jmalicki> and then further working under others to refine skills
02:02 < jmalicki> notmike: even then, a lot of those people end up somehow working with others on like e.g. opensource or something
02:04 < jmalicki> https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666
02:05 < jmalicki> (it's mostly just pop self-help, but it's about precisely that)
02:15 < jmalicki> notmike: oh yeah, those were green berets anyway, i guess seals wouldn't be the mvp ;P
02:15 < jmalicki> but i am nowhere near either
02:15 < jmalicki> so i won't talk shit
02:15 < jmalicki> just that there is some basic level of preparation to have any hope at all
02:20 < jmalicki> air force combat control is my favorite, it totally makes sense, but i never would have imagined on my own
02:21 < jmalicki> special forces air traffic controllers certified by the FAA
02:22 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: <jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you don't have huge needs you can script like elitetrader or quantopian or something
02:22 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: is above $200.000 considered a huge need?
02:22 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: it's more how much latency and computational power and symbols
02:22 < jmalicki> not size of portfolio
02:22 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: like, could you run your strategy off a raspberry pi?
02:23 < jmalicki> ya
02:23 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you *need* that
02:23 < jmalicki> for your strategy to work
02:23 < jmalicki> if you don't, quantopian or something is nice
02:23 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: with quantopian, you don't even need to raise funds
02:24 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: you upload your code, and if it works, they start allocating you funds and paying you a management fee
02:24 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: so that's a great place to start if you fit their model
02:24 < jmalicki> hammond^
02:25 < jmalicki> https://www.quantopian.com/get-funded
02:25 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: no
02:25 < jmalicki> maybe at some point in the distant future if i'm wildly successful
02:26 < jmalicki> "Our agreement pays authors a share of the performance fee Quantopian charges, typically 10% of net total profits earned by the algorithm." "Get funded with up to $50 million for your idea."
02:27 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: so if you make like 30%/yr, you could be getting $1.5million per year from quantopian
02:27 < jmalicki> up to
02:27 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: you could like make millions
02:27 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: of course, you're only getting 10% of profits, not 100%
02:27 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: but you can earn that while you're setting it up outside of their infra
02:28 < jmalicki> well i don't know if they make you sign exclusivity or whatever
02:28 < jmalicki> and/or like a commitment
02:28 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: but you can just upload some python code and make money
02:28 < jmalicki> if it works well enough for them to fund
02:29 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: plus, you can point to your public performance on quantopian to any potential investors
02:29 < notmike> jmalicki: oh yeah, they're super important. They and groups like 160th soar setup farps (fuel, ammo, resupply points) skiing many other tasks
02:29 < jmalicki> notmike: it's just... a job i never would have imagined would exist before i heard about
02:29 < jmalicki> the world's most badass 
02:29 < jmalicki> FAA air traffic controller
02:31 < PeteHansen> i like the name jmalicki, no homo or anything, but my name starts with jma too. and maliki.. for some reason its always been one of my favorite names
02:32 < jmalicki> notmike: yeah i mean atc is a great job
02:36 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: keep your binarism out of here
02:36 < PeteHansen> sorry jmalicki 
02:37 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: everybody went on about how this channel allowed going offtopic on almost anything. now i know that unspoken rule only applies when nobody's saying anything wise.
02:38 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: you just don't know if Brie is non-binary or not
02:38 < jmalicki> don't assume
02:39 < PeteHansen> binarism is so 1950s huh? =) anyway back to work after /lastlog jmalicki 
02:47 < as2333_> PeteHansen, jmalicki is pulling your leg
02:51 < jmalicki> as2333_: about what?
02:55 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: sounds like bpd
02:55 < PeteHansen> jmalicki can pull both my legs and both my arms if he wants the dude might just saved my business.. (i assumed he because i felt it'd be rude to say "it")
02:56 < jmalicki> quantopian is really cool, just the strategies i've found that are good enough to interest me are beyond what it can do
02:59 < jmalicki> 3 years of postgraduate education and 17 years of professional experience
03:00 < jmalicki> chance favors the prepared mind.
03:02 < as2333_> and jmalicki doesnt have a point - so his comment was a joke - either on purpose or not.
03:06 < jmalicki> PeteHansen: i should have specified keep your gender binarism out of here
03:08 < as2333_> jmalicki, keep your feminazi garbage out of here
03:08 < PeteHansen> jmalicki: i couldnt care less about genders. but i care a little bit about Brie because we norwegians deeply admire and look up to the finns. foreign culture fascination deluxe. i wasn't trying to offend any genders
22:43 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: it's usually easiest to sell after the crash starts and buy after the recovery begins
22:43 <jmalicki> e.g. don't get too greedy
22:44 <jmalicki> it's next to impossible to tell the actual top and bottom
22:44 <jmalicki> but other people will disagree :)
22:44 <jmalicki> tryphe_++
00:01 <jmalicki> apotheon: i mean, it literally does mean you can afford it
00:01 <jmalicki> apotheon: quite literally
00:02 <apotheon> jmalicki: No, it means you can incur a debt of that size.
00:02 <jmalicki> apotheon: which you can then use to purchase the home
00:02 <apotheon> jmalicki: Affording it means being able to pay that debt down.
00:02 <jmalicki> apotheon: they want to know if they can afford the house, not the debt
00:02 <jmalicki> apotheon: you can just buy the house with the mortgage, then not pay it, and continue to live there.
00:03 <apotheon> jmalicki: You can squat in an abandoned building, too.
00:03 <jmalicki> yep!
00:03 <jmalicki> yep!
00:04 <jmalicki> apotheon: you just take out the mortgage and challenge it in court
00:04 <jmalicki> apotheon: since standard practices in mortgages don't follow legal requirements
00:04 <apotheon> jmalicki: You must live somewhere that taking possession of a house away from the bank when you defaulted on the loan is easy.
00:04 <jmalicki> apotheon: so if you have a mortgage like 90% of them, you really don't have to pay
00:05 <jmalicki> apotheon: no, it's a state where the bank taking possession of the house and enforcing the lien is hard
00:05 <jmalicki> apotheon: the bank does not own the house, they merely have a lien
00:05 <jmalicki> turning the lien into owning the house can be difficult
00:07 <jmalicki> apotheon: if the bank fucked up their paperwork, and you can properly defend yourself and you know the law, there is nothing they can do. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/false-affidavits-foreclosures-what-robo-34185.html
00:08 <jmalicki> only if you have a victim mentality
00:08 <apotheon> jmalicki: Oh, are we assuming the bank screwed up the paperwork?
00:08 <jmalicki> apotheon: it happens quite frequently
00:08 <jmalicki> apotheon: banks that happily give people mortgages they can't afford are usually incompetent in other areas too
00:09 <jmalicki> apotheon: oh the whole deal isn't null and void - you get to keep their money
00:09 <jmalicki> they just have no rights to repossess
00:09 <jmalicki> you just have unsecured debt
00:10 <jmalicki> apotheon: the bank has to prove in the affirmative that they can repossess
00:10 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt - no... prior to 2008 foreclosures were infrequent, so banks didn't bother dotting all the is and crossing all the ts cause you have to pay expensive lawyers for that.
00:10 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: no - but they do have to get lots of paperwork right to repossess it
00:11 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: i won't, but plenty of other lawyers who have frequently won these cases will
00:11 <apotheon> NoImNotNineVolt: I suspect jmalicki is not talking about your home jursdiction.
00:11 <jmalicki> apotheon: it's 25 states
00:11 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: so you're saying that it was just a well kept secret for a while that you could get houses for free?
00:11 <jmalicki> so it's common
00:11 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yeah
00:11 <apotheon> jmalicki: Does that include European states?
00:11 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: where was this?
00:11 <jmalicki> apotheon: i have zero idea what european law is
00:12 <apotheon> jmalicki: That was my point.  I don't know where NoImNotNineVolt is located.
00:12 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: the states on the left https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/chart-judicial-v-nonjudicial-foreclosures.html
00:12 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: the bank has to affirmatively prove they own the home
00:13 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: all you have to do to challenge is say "prove it" in court
00:13 <jmalicki> basically
00:13 <jmalicki> and if they can't
00:13 <jmalicki> well they're fucked
00:13 <jmalicki> (banks have gotten waaaaay better off about this since fucking that up a lot)
00:13 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: that's what i mean... they COULD NOT show they were the lienholder
00:14 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: since they fucked up the process of getting it with fraudulent documents
00:14 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: because the paperwork was fraudulently signed by employees who did not do legally required due diligence before signing their name
00:15 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: since the bank employee misrepresented their due diligence, the document was fraudulent
00:15 <jmalicki> and the lien void
00:15 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: due diligence regarding what?
00:15 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: the validity of the lien
00:15 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: just google robosigning
00:15 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_foreclosure_crisis#Robo-signing_controversy
00:16 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: there are legal requirements to attest that you hold the lien when filing it
00:16 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: if you do not meet those legal requirements, the lien is void
00:16 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: this was tested in MANY court cases
00:17 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: http://www.google.com
00:18 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt++
00:19 <jmalicki> lol
00:20 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: https://theintercept.com/2016/02/19/siding-with-a-victim-of-fraudulent-foreclosure-california-court-exposes-a-failure-of-law-enforcement/

00:21 <jmalicki> the same sloppy practices that led to loan officers approving mortgages they shouldn't also often meant sloppy in getting a legally valid lien
00:21 <jmalicki> once word got out that these were widespread a lot more people challenged foreclosures
00:22 <NoImNotNineVolt> jmalicki: that's a wrongful foreclosure case where the court ruled in favor of the homeowner due to the puculiar nature of the way her mortgage was transfered after she became party to it.
00:22 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yes, that is exactly what i mean.
00:22 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: that peculiar nature was *quite common*
00:23 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: oh, you can't ensure they fuck up
00:23 <jmalicki> and they're better about it now
00:23 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yes, it is
00:23 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: the peculiar nature *was* robosigning
00:24 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yes
00:24 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: it's not about the *financial  status*
00:24 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: correct, the latter is what i'm talking about.
00:24 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: there was.
00:25 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: it has nothing to do with the financial status of the borrower, none of these cases do.
00:25 <jmalicki> it's just sloppy practices in one area mean it's just a shittily managed operation
00:25 <jmalicki> that is probably fucking up other areas
00:25 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: nope. it was about paperwork in transferring
00:26 <jmalicki> ""Robo-signing" is a term used by consumer advocates to describe the robotic process of the mass production of false and forged execution of mortgage assignments,..."
00:26 <jmalicki> ^ mortgage assignment, that case
00:27 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: i think banks have learned their lessons on this one
00:27 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: yeah
00:27 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: and also drowning in creating MBS
00:27 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: like in tons of cases it wasn't legally clear who actually owned the mortgage
00:28 <jmalicki> so it was in limbo
00:28 <jmalicki> *no party* could prove they owned the mortgage
00:28 <jmalicki> because when they sold it the assignment got messed up
00:28 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: but in 20 years the people who got burned will be gone, and the new executives will again be like "let's cut costs!"
00:28 <jmalicki> and they'll fuck it up again
00:29 <jmalicki> ya
00:29 <jmalicki> (if the bank can prove it :)
00:31 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: like, Wells Fargo settled an $83 million lawsuit over it http://www.startribune.com/wells-fargo-settling-robo-signing-lawsuit/260489421/
00:31 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: like sure, the majority they could prove it
00:32 <jmalicki> but there were enough where banks couldn't that it was a HUUUGE deal
00:33 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: it wasn't a couple of cases though
00:33 <jmalicki> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/GVJ7wF58/
00:33 <jmalicki> https://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/research_briefs/Foreclosure-Gate.pdf
00:34 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: this was not an isolated case
00:34 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: i'm not your legal assistant.
00:35 <jmalicki> ya
00:36 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: just saying, the banks with the fucked up management that gave loans to people who couldn't afford them were usually messing up lots of other things too
00:37 <jmalicki> did they like it?
00:37 <jmalicki> :)
00:39 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: and sure, this was a technicality
00:39 <jmalicki> not like... that they didn't actually own the home in the reasonable sense
00:40 <jmalicki> but the standard to take someone's home away from them is rightly somewhat high
00:44 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-foreclosures-zombies/special-report-the-latest-foreclosure-horror-the-zombie-title-idUSBRE9090G920130110
00:44 <jmalicki> 2 million people got free houses
00:45 <jmalicki> it wasn't like just 1 or 2
00:45 <jmalicki> ya banks were like ummm
00:45 <jmalicki> we can't actually win yhis foreclosure, so uh
00:45 <jmalicki> louipc: i mean, a lot of them were like in horrible parts of detroit etc
00:46 <jmalicki> NoImNotNineVolt: a full 20% of the foreclosures after 2010
00:46 <jmalicki> banks really fucked that one up
00:46 <jmalicki> ya
00:48 <jmalicki> (most of it wasn't about whether the borrower owed money, but about who they legally owed money to)
00:53 <jmalicki> (well not totally free - they don't have clear titles)
00:53 <jmalicki> it's just in limbo
01:05 <jmalicki> ya lol the great depression was such a giant dumpster fire that it's hard to tell if something could have made it worse or not
01:08 <jmalicki> oh interesting http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/econ315/whaples2123771.pdf
01:09 <jmalicki> there is way more controversy on some of those points than i thought
01:10 <jmalicki> (though it was also 22 years ago, maybe some of it has changed)
01:14 <jmalicki> isn't it that you can't sell your factory to pay off your loan, because your factory is worth less?
01:15 <notmike> jmalicki: that's part of it sure
01:15 <jmalicki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation
01:16 <jmalicki> apotheon: are there non-debt driven economies of any reasonable size?
01:17 <notmike> jmalicki: I think it's related
01:18  * jmalicki doesn't understand islamic finance, is it free of this problem?
01:18 <apotheon> jmalicki: Debt is the standard way to manage an economy these days.
01:21 <jmalicki> huh interesting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_and_loss_sharing
01:21 <jmalicki> apotheon: so it seems that the answer to these problems is sharia law
01:25 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: dogecoin
01:25 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: cool thanks
01:26 <jmalicki> notmike: no
01:26 <louipc> jmalicki: YES
01:26 <jmalicki> but like, even in the US there are a lot
01:26 <jmalicki> notmike: like the federalist society, law and economics, etc etc
01:28 <jmalicki> looool "Very bubble. Much scam. So avoid." https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/business/cryptocurrency-bubble-doge.html
01:28 <jmalicki> louipc: jesus is also important in judaism
01:29 <jmalicki> louipc: https://jewsforjesus.org/
01:29 <louipc> jmalicki: oh really i didnt know that
01:29 <jmalicki> they're not christians, just jews who accept jesus as their savior.
01:30 <jmalicki> louipc: i mean just look at ireland
01:30 <louipc> jmalicki: loltru
01:30 <jmalicki> louipc: the disagreement is over whether or not they're engaging in cannibalism at church, they agree on everything else
01:33 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: citation?
01:34 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: SWVXX
01:34 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: holy tracking error batman
01:34 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: you know most index funds don't actually invest in the index right?
01:34 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: they "seek to match the index's performance"
01:34 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_error
01:35 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: it must be? like that's the definition of tracking error
01:35 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like any time the fund perf. doesn't match the index perf. is tracking error by definition
01:35 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: the question is where it came from
01:35 <jmalicki> louipc: carefully research how rigorously they track the index
01:36 <jmalicki> louipc: not all sp500 index funds are the same
01:36 <jmalicki> marginal_: yeah, vanguard is worse than communism.
01:37 <apotheon> jmalicki: Are you saying Vanguard is worse than communism because it deals in index funds?
01:37 <jmalicki> apotheon: yes
01:38 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: there are major structural ETF differences that make tracking better
01:38 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like SPY you can directly exchange so many shares for shares of the underlying
01:38 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: so you can arb tracking error
01:38 <jmalicki> which makes it go away
01:39 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: are you positive you're looking at the right day?
01:41 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: maybe its a glitch in their website
01:41 <jmalicki> when i looked on the schwab website the fine print says "as of close Dec 20" RustyShackleford 
01:42 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: I just noticed that yeah
01:42 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/mutualfunds/summary.asp?symbol=SWPPX
01:42 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: that has the same numbers, but says "Dec 20"
01:43 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: so maybe that's when yahoo got the quote, but Schwab hasn't yet published a new NAV?
01:43 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: refresh the page
01:43 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: oh i'm not
01:43 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: ah
01:48 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: it sounds like equity is fine?
01:48 <RustyShackleford> jmalicki: not sure what you mean
01:48 <jmalicki> well maybe
01:48 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: like buying a share of acompany
01:48 <jmalicki> dividends etc might be complicated
01:48 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: not all of them
01:48 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: not sure
01:48 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: but most of the islamic finance stuff is vaguely a lot like stocks
01:49 <jmalicki> but there might be some important fine print etc
01:50 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: my understanding is the #1 way you invest halal is instead of earning a 5% interest, you get a fixed monthly fee that *just happens for no reason* to correspond to 5% of the value loaned
01:50 <jmalicki> but *it's not interest*!
01:50 <jmalicki> RustyShackleford: sort of like Eruvs, this weird suspension of reality
01:51 <jmalicki> "we're really indoors, we swear!"
01:51  * jmalicki still finds eruvs sort of hilarious
01:52 <jmalicki> notmike: lol
01:52 <jmalicki> notmike: scientology is real though
01:52 <jmalicki> yeah
02:16 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: what's wrong with hijabs? when you see a christian wearing a cross necklace or a jew wearing a yarmulke, do you also want to rip those off?
02:17 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: what if they're just bank robbers and nonreligious?
02:17 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: nothing wrong they can wear what they like but it has nothing to do with islam
02:18 <jmalicki> oh you said when you see a hijab you want to rip them off
02:19 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: what if people just like to wear burkas?
02:21 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: what about christian veils that are an extension of christianity like https://www.pinterest.com/pin/249668373065272294/?lp=true ?
02:21 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: i dunno havent read the coptic bible..
02:23 <jmalicki> notmike: def. one who puts herself on display
02:24 <jmalicki> notmike: what about like https://twitter.com/rmshazib/status/735835130304958464
02:25 <jmalicki> notmike: that woman is both guarding her modesty despite it being unpopular, and putting herself on display
02:26 <jmalicki> notmike: you know he was black right?
02:27 <notmike> jmalicki: I have heard this
02:27 <armitage7> jmalicki: I guess? I just assumed he was a local
02:28 <jmalicki> notmike: so if it's not a gangbang it's not cheating?
02:29 <notmike> jmalicki: basically, yeah, I think they probably killed the guy who knew about the event too
02:29 <jmalicki> notmike: that seems pretty empowering for womens' sexuality
02:31 <jmalicki> notmike: ah cool, so like tardigrades to mohammed
02:31 <jmalicki> notmike: like, do dogs have full legal rights in sharia law?
02:32 <notmike> jmalicki: yeah, even Jinn are muslim or nonbelievers
02:34 <jmalicki> huh
02:34 <jmalicki> nice cnn has a shutdown clock
02:37 <jmalicki> https://www.popsci.com/visit-national-park-government-shutdown
02:37 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: this look about right? sorry i couldnt figure out how to make it full screen: http://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/ey3vbb55/
02:38 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: 100% doge, the rest are going to 0
02:40 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: i assume you haven't seen https://youtu.be/000al7ru3ms
02:40 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you think the others have a chance
02:41 <hammond> jmalicki: our resident jew.
02:42 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: thanks checking
02:44 <PeteHansen> lol jmalicki 
02:47 <jmalicki> it's hilarious that despite being a joke, doge is like the only crypto that actually works as a currency
02:47 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: cheers for the tip :D
02:53 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: Elm is where it's at
02:53 <jmalicki> https://elm-lang.org/
02:55 <PeteHansen> daaaaaamn jmalicki! that looks hot!!! *tssssssssht* ouch almost burned myself
02:56 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: it helps you write correct javascript by checking most things at compile time
02:56 <jmalicki> so you can catch a lot of errors without actually running the code
02:56 <jmalicki> like you can see your onclick code is broken before clicking the button
02:57 <jmalicki> sometimes at least
03:00 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: you seem very exciteable :)
03:02 <jmalicki> notmike: do you read arabic?
03:02 <notmike> jmalicki: I do
03:02 <jmalicki> nice!
03:02 <notmike> jmalicki: I was just telling PeteHansen how the Quran is actually meant to be heard rather than read
03:02 <jmalicki> nice
03:03 <jmalicki> notmike: the Quran has vowels right?
03:03 <jmalicki> ah
03:04 <notmike> jmalicki: eventually, given the context, you just know what word it is
03:06 <jmalicki> hammond: have you read the quran in arabic?
03:06 <jmalicki> hammond: how do you know what islam is?
03:08 <hammond> supoose I told you I banged your wife in the ass and she liked it and told me to bring some more guys tomorrow in a different language jmalicki .
03:08 <jmalicki> hammond: nice,  i like to watch
03:29 <jmalicki> hammond: we might have a lot less violence in the world if that happened
04:18 <jmalicki> hammond: do you put the parties you went to in high school on your calendar?
04:18 <jmalicki> did you work on your calendar with your dad?
04:18 <jmalicki> lol
04:19 <jmalicki> hammond: kavanaugh
04:19 <jmalicki> i was trying to make a kavanaugh joke
04:19 <jmalicki> ah sorry you meant kavanaugh odd not my attempt at a joke
04:20 <jmalicki> https://thehardtimes.net/culture/andrew-w-k-releases-his-calendar-from-1982-to-prove-he-was-at-every-party/
04:20 <jmalicki> "“Yeah, I drank apple juice with my friends,” he added. “Almost everyone did. Sometimes, I had too much apple juice; sometimes, others did. Let me be clear, though: I liked apple juice, I still like apple juice, but I did not drink apple juice to the point of wetting my own pants.”"
04:20 <jmalicki> ya
04:21 <jmalicki> dunno
04:21 <jmalicki> he lived in georgetown so prolly
04:21 <jmalicki> ah
04:21 <jmalicki> hammond: yup https://prabook.com/web/everett.kavanaugh/1365780
04:22 <jmalicki> hammond++ called it
04:40 <hammond> jmalicki: did u read de prado book on finance?
04:40 <jmalicki> hammond: yes
04:40 <jmalicki> hammond: skimming it it seemed awesome
04:40 <jmalicki> after reading it closely i found it meh
04:40 <jmalicki> but i've read a *lot*
04:41 <jmalicki> i found some.... blatant just errors that should not have passed peer review
04:41 <jmalicki> which kind of colored my view
04:41 <jmalicki> but the high level concepts i found good
04:41 <jmalicki> ummm
04:41 <jmalicki> hammond: been like 6 months lemme skim it
04:42 <jmalicki> hammond: don't believe it has anything i would describe as such
04:42 <jmalicki> hammond: it's an academic text with equations and shit
04:42 <jmalicki> i would be surprised if audible delivered the content well
04:43 <jmalicki> hammond: if you haven't read a lot of quant stuff it's amazing
04:43 <jmalicki> like the intro is spot on etc
04:43 <jmalicki> the more technical stuff is kinda meh
04:43 <jmalicki> hammond: but "how to think of the big picture" it is like awesome
04:44 <jmalicki> hammond: i just... it makes a lot of statements as fact that are really just opinions etc
04:44 <jmalicki> and makes a handful of blatantly wrong statements
04:44 <jmalicki> hammond: i mean it's a generally ok book on like machine learning shit
04:45 <jmalicki> hammond: like it said boosting decreases bias... like that statement is just plain factually wrong
04:45 <jmalicki> like mathematically proveably wrong
04:45 <jmalicki> but like
04:45 <jmalicki> hammond: the super mathy stuff is a bit suspect
04:45 <hammond> jmalicki: I like that he doesn't focus on the fact that AI is used to predict prices. Instead he uses it to for other things such as bet sizing. and other such.... I looked at some of his talks. but idk what that all means.
04:45 <jmalicki> hammond: but if you don't take the details as gosepl
04:45 <jmalicki> hammond: exactly!
04:45 <jmalicki> hammond: he tells you how to think about the overall problem
04:46 <jmalicki> and what pieces things have
04:46 <jmalicki> and intros every part well
04:46 <jmalicki> hammond: my only big beefs are when he gets super technical he's compeltely wrong sometimes
04:46 <jmalicki> but that shouldn't take away from the overall value
04:46 <jmalicki> like the labeling chapter is like
04:47 <jmalicki> you just have some rando ideas you're pushing as best practices, but like
04:47 <jmalicki> worth considering
04:47 <jmalicki> but he presents them as like generally accepted best practices, when it's just something one (really smart) guy made up
04:47 <jmalicki> which i think is unfair
04:48 <jmalicki> like you should distinguish
04:48 <jmalicki> "this is a cool idea i came up with in the shower" from "this is something with 25 years of consensus"
04:49 <jmalicki> hammond: but i think it's probably bar none the best high-level overview of how to build a quant trading system
04:49 <jmalicki> by faaaar
04:50 <jmalicki> hammond: the fractionally differentiated features chapter i glossed over, like i'll come back to it, thanks for reminding me
04:50 <jmalicki> i was like this is super deep and potentially super interesting, but i wanted light reading
04:50 <jmalicki> but i need to read more
04:50 <jmalicki> i've heard a lot about that from many sources
04:51 <jmalicki> fractional differentiation is closely related to fractals and mandelbrot etc
04:52 <hammond> next you will tell me that technical analysis has some merits too jmalicki 
04:52 <jmalicki> hammond: my basic system is on a high level TA
04:52 <jmalicki> hammond: in that it uses past prices to predict the future
04:52 <jmalicki> prices and other market data
04:52 <jmalicki> hammond: it's just that most of what gets lumped under TA is like.... quackery
04:53 <jmalicki> hammond: in the same way that witch doctors are still doctors
04:53 <jmalicki> of a sort
04:53 <jmalicki> and practicing medicine
04:53 <jmalicki> of a sort
04:53 <hammond> jmalicki: what other books are good reads.
04:54 <jmalicki> hammond: for machine learning i think the best book is https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf if you have the proper prep (like you need to be good at linear algebra to read it effectively)
04:54 <jmalicki> hammond: ernie chan's blog is.... okay
04:54 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: i'm curious how good the audiobook is
04:55 <jmalicki> like i dunno how you do equations and tables and graphs in an audiobook?
04:55 <jmalicki> lol
04:55 <jmalicki> hammond: this is very long but good for inspiration https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5386.html
04:55 <jmalicki> hammond: i dunno if i'd take any of the techniques too seriously as explicit things to use
04:56 <jmalicki> hammond: but like, how to reason about time series prediction problems in general
04:56 <jmalicki> and different ways to think about things
04:57 <jmalicki> hammond: https://www.amazon.com/Econometrics-Financial-Markets-John-Campbell/dp/0691043019 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576603490/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSISLM/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4
04:57 <jmalicki> all good
04:57 <jmalicki> andrew lo++
04:57 <jmalicki> hammond: for quant on order books https://www.amazon.com/Empirical-Market-Microstructure-Institutions-Econometrics-ebook/dp/B005254I1K/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1545451043&sr=1-5&keywords=microstructure
04:57 <jmalicki> hammond: like whole limit order books like nasdaq level 2, not just trades
04:59 <jmalicki> hammond: this is good for a less academic more practical read on the nitty gritty of the finer details of exactly how stock markets work, at the micro level https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Trading-DMA-introduction-strategies/dp/0956399207/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1545451110&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=algorithmic+trading+and+dma
04:59 <jmalicki> hammond: like what happens, exactly, when you submit an order through your broker
04:59 <jmalicki> in fine detail
05:00 <jmalicki> hammond: there is one pretty famous r finance dude... doug engelbart or something? works for citadel maybe?
05:00 <jmalicki> no not doug engelbart
05:00 <jmalicki> umm
05:01 <jmalicki> hammond: Dirk Eddelbuettel
05:01 <jmalicki> famous among quants who use R at least
05:02 <hammond> jmalicki: depardo talks about regime change, is it like when you have different strats for different regimes, that you figure when to use each strat more than the others?
05:02 <jmalicki> hammond: i don't think he actually mentions that but like
05:02 <jmalicki> hammond: if you use a highly nonparametric model
05:02 <jmalicki> like tree ensembles or neural networks
05:03 <jmalicki> hammond: just add features useful in predicting the regime to your model, and it all happens automatically, no need to be explicit
05:03 <jmalicki> like there may be slight advantages to being explicit
05:03 <jmalicki> but i would put those as being very advanced
05:04 <jmalicki> hammond: e.g. if you have a minute by minute model, add some features for performance over the 3 prior days etc to help predict regime
05:04 <jmalicki> or like, last quarters GDP whatevs
05:04 <jmalicki> hammond: a feature might be percent change over the last minute
05:04 <jmalicki> hammond: might be percent of typical daily volume over the past minute
05:04 <jmalicki> etc etc
05:05 <jmalicki> hammond: what day of the week it is
05:05 <jmalicki> hammond: is this an options expiry day?
05:05 <jmalicki> hammond: how many minutes since market open/until close
05:05 <hammond> I see now jmalicki 
05:05 <jmalicki> etc etc etc
05:05 <jmalicki> hammond: how are other stocks in the same sector doing?
05:05 <jmalicki> i am opening my kimono a bit too much here
05:06 <jmalicki> lol
05:07 <jmalicki> hammond: for limit order book, where you can see the identity of the limit order (e.g. this limit order is GS, this one Two sigma, etc)
05:08 <jmalicki> hammond: which players usually earn the bid ask bounce, vs. get fucked
05:08 <jmalicki> hammond: and if it's a player that gets fucked less, and they are one sided, pay attention
05:08 <jmalicki> like if they are pulling back on their bids or asks
05:08 <jmalicki> you know they have detected something is up
05:11 <jmalicki> hammond: did that make sense to you?
05:11 <jmalicki> i dunno if i explained it wel
05:12 <jmalicki> hammond: oh oh oh https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5GNFVS84EAR7AZ6V6SNW
05:12 <jmalicki> just got released been reading my copy
05:12 <jmalicki> hammond: first update after 20 years (a looooot has changed)
05:12 <jmalicki> hammond: reinforcement learning is useful for predicting trade sizes and fill etc
05:13 <jmalicki> hammond: because if you trade, you change the path
05:13 <jmalicki> hammond: so just using supervised learning is hard
05:13 <jmalicki> hammond: in practice supervised learning is good enough for reinforcement learning problems if other players are only minimally reacting to you
05:13 <jmalicki> but the more your action changes the action of others
05:13 <jmalicki> the more doing it right becomes
05:14 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: for a startup i would use AWS
05:14 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: if you run 24/7 it runs abbout 3x what buying the computers costs per year
05:14 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: but usually you're doing it in short bursts
05:14 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: so you're paying a lot per hour, but there's no commitment or capital expenditure
05:15 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: like you can rent an amazon x1.8xlarge with like 64 cores and 2TB of memory
05:15 <MoarSpaceFi> jmalicki, AWS isn't the only game out there and there are possibilities of getting grant money
05:15 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: oh sure!
05:16 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi: but 128 cores and 2TB of memory is somehting a lot of the competition can't match
05:16 <jmalicki> x1.32xlarge	
05:16 <jmalicki> if you really need to do machine learning on big data, that is great
05:16 <jmalicki> distributed systems of smaller machines is a lot more work and has huuuge overhead
05:17 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: xgboost and pytorch are the only names you really need for machine learning software
05:17 <jmalicki> there are a bunch of others
05:17 <jmalicki> but 90% of the best projects just use those two
05:17 <jmalicki> i shall claim ;P
05:18 <jmalicki> hammond: timescaledb is a really cool new project for storing the data
05:19 <jmalicki> i haven't tried it yet since i built my warehouse before it existed
05:19 <jmalicki> MoarSpaceFi++
05:21 <hammond> ok, for the record though for the record I'm obligated to disclose that my research took me to finding the absolute theory of investing which is "it's not about ROI it's all about AuM", which jmalicki obvs does not agree with me, and I'm jst now revisting these ROI increasing theories to see whether somekind of alpha can be scalped or what's the deal here.
05:22 <jmalicki> hammond: oh that is def. true
05:22 <jmalicki> hammond: but that's about being a sales guy
05:22 <jmalicki> hammond: i am a geek
05:22 <jmalicki> so for me it's about roi ;P
05:22 <jmalicki> hammond: but HFT isn't really ROI as a rate, it's more like fixed revenue regardless of capital
05:23 <jmalicki> hammond: HFT tends to have really really high ROI, but you can't get that ROI on your profits
05:23 <jmalicki> hammond: so you have to put your profits somewhere else.
05:23 <jmalicki> hammond: OPM
05:23 <jmalicki> hammond: other people's money
05:24 <jmalicki> hammond: hopefully you are friends with lots of dentists
05:24 <jmalicki> they love putting their money in crappy investment schemes that are overly complicated ;P
05:24 <jmalicki> dentists are like regarded as the prime target rube of wall st
05:24 <jmalicki> they're accredited investors making over $200k
05:25 <jmalicki> lol
05:25 <jmalicki> hammond: you just have to not compete head on with the big guys
05:25 <jmalicki> hammond: like Jane Street which has like dozens of MIT PhDs and 20 years on you does market making for ETFs
05:25 <jmalicki> so like
05:25 <jmalicki> you probably shouldn't do market making for ETFs
05:25 <jmalicki> etc
05:25 <jmalicki> have a niche the successful ones haven't touched yet
05:26 <jmalicki> hammond: like if you're like i want to start an internet company
05:26 <jmalicki> maybe "search engine" or "social network" shouldn't be your first picks
05:26 <jmalicki> then again, you could have said that about google or facebook when they started, so.....
05:27 <jmalicki> lol
05:27 <jmalicki> hammond: one of my college professors was a hedge fund quant and said most of his job was like "see? we have a phd professor designing our strategies, he's really smart"
05:27 <jmalicki> and that was 90% of his job
05:28 <jmalicki> not doing anything
05:28 <jmalicki> just lending credibility
05:31 <jmalicki> hammond: if you have a bunch of strats, use portfolio optimization to combine them
05:31 <jmalicki> hammond: http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/ecos.html
05:31 <jmalicki> hammond: read about markowitz portfolio optimization
05:31 <jmalicki> hammond: and use that software to fit the weights
05:32 <jmalicki> hammond: so like strat A gets 10% of portfolio strat b 20% etc optimally
05:32 <jmalicki> to maximize return and minimize risk
05:32 <jmalicki> hammond: so like this minimizes correlation between strats while maximizing return
05:32 <jmalicki> so if two strats perform well in opposite times
05:32 <jmalicki> that helps to offset each other etc
05:33 <jmalicki> notmike++
05:33 <jmalicki> hammond: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory
05:33 <jmalicki> hammond: i dunno if any of the books i listed cover that
05:33 <jmalicki> hammond: but suuuper important
05:33 <jmalicki> hammond: probably an undergrad investment finance book?
05:34 <jmalicki> hammond: it's like the cornerstone of like an undergrad finance degree probably
05:34 <jmalicki> hammond: basically like how to diversify
05:34 <jmalicki> hammond: multi-armed bandits from reinforcement learning also do that adaptably in realtime
05:34 <jmalicki> hammond: like do thompson sampling on your strats
05:35 <jmalicki> notmike people also call it optimum portfolio allocation
05:35 <jmalicki> hammond: https://conversionxl.com/blog/bandit-tests/
05:36 <jmalicki> hammond: thompson sampling doesn't care about correlation though
05:36 <jmalicki> but there are...extensions... but they would like require a phd to implement
05:36 <jmalicki> like there aren't beginner tutorials on the mix between
05:37 <jmalicki> notmike: warren buffet has also been in a multi-decade threesome
05:37 <jmalicki> they all live together
05:37 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: dropout
05:38 <jmalicki> ya
05:39 <jmalicki> hammond: cool
05:39 <jmalicki> hammond: how long does it take to transport it?
05:40 <jmalicki> notmike: i was asked the st. petersburg paradox as a warmup in an interview
05:40 <hammond> jmalicki: well.... tell me something if all goes your way what kind of ROI are you looking at for a good year?
05:41 <notmike> jmalicki: aww that's easy
05:41 <jmalicki> hammond: 20000%, capping at $20M/mo
05:41 <jmalicki> notmike: yeah and etc etc etc
05:41 <jmalicki> notmike: like that's a philosophical question
05:41 <jmalicki> hammond: i mean, i have some doubts
05:41 <jmalicki> hammond: but the number is so high that like even if tons go wrong
05:41 <jmalicki> it still may be something
05:41 <jmalicki> hammond: like if i get scraps of that
05:42 <jmalicki> i'll be alright
05:42 <notmike> jmalicki: you know Allais Paradox?
05:42 <jmalicki> no
05:42 <jmalicki> hammond: my backtests were showing 40%/day
05:42 <jmalicki> hammond: no, two weeks
05:43 <jmalicki> hammond:  i mean, there are probably fill and slippage problems beyond what i expect
05:43 <jmalicki> hammond: but 40%/day leaves lots of room for error
05:43 <jmalicki> so we'll see
05:43 <jmalicki> hammond: but also if you talk to anyone who knows HFT
05:43 <jmalicki> hammond: returns are enormous in %, but cap out quick
05:44 <jmalicki> hammond: so it's more like fixed revenue
05:44 <jmalicki> not a compound return
05:44 <jmalicki> the capital base required is tiny when people in the game talk about it
05:44 <jmalicki> but you can only make this much money
05:44 <jmalicki> and then it's eroded by competition
05:44 <jmalicki> it doesn't continue to grow forever
05:46 <jmalicki> hammond: to make more money you need to go long term
05:46 <jmalicki> hammond: cuz like when you compound
05:46 <jmalicki> hammond: if you're trading 100 shares of aapl no biggie
05:46 <jmalicki> hammond: if you trade 10000 shares, you have issues
05:46 <jmalicki> hammond: i mean, i built retail assumptions in.
05:47 <jmalicki> hammond: and found a niche academics have proved noone is doing and i was like i bet i can do that
05:47 <jmalicki> hammond: i've worked for large tech companies finding patterns of fraud etc
05:47 <jmalicki> which isn't that different from a big trader buying a bunch of small lots of stock
05:47 <jmalicki> and i was like i bet i can find that
05:47 <jmalicki> so when i finish coding i'll see...
05:48 <jmalicki> hammond: i don't believe those extreme numbers will actually be achievable
05:48 <jmalicki> hammond: but i was like, there are no gaping errors in this analysis, i'll leave the rest as a margin for error
05:48 <jmalicki> since if it is merely 300%/yr that is also awesome
05:49 <jmalicki> (up to some cap of course)
05:49 <jmalicki> bye
05:51 <jmalicki> hammond: that;s why i stopped analysis and started implementing
05:51 <jmalicki> like if this is off by a lot of % that's fine
05:51 <jmalicki> there's just nothing that totally invalidates it
05:51 <jmalicki> for now
05:51 <notmike> jmalicki: re: deflation https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflationary-spiral.asp
05:51 <jmalicki> notmike++++
05:53 <jmalicki> hahaha buffet picked up his date in a hearse while wearing a tophat and fur coat
05:53 <jmalicki> lol
05:53 <jmalicki> hammond: fair enough time will tell
05:54 <notmike> jmalicki: he was stylin in that fur coat omg
05:59 <jmalicki> hammond: maybe cuz it's held by a broker?
05:59 <jmalicki> do you have the certificate?
06:02 <jmalicki> "he made a lot of money trading thinly traded securities"
06:02 <jmalicki> yes! do not compete with the big boys
06:03 <jmalicki> find the little tiny niches
06:03 <jmalicki> notmike++
07:50 <jmalicki> notmike: reality is a social construction
07:50 <jmalicki> notmike: our operating thetans just need to be uploaded to AWS
07:50 <notmike> jmalicki: I have something for you
07:50 <jmalicki> notmike: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaftqCORT4
07:51 <jmalicki> notmike: lol gardasil is now approved for men up to 45
07:54 <jmalicki> lol
07:54 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: just bought Advances in Financial Machine Learning the audio version, thanks again man
07:57 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: i hope the audio is actually useful... i am skeptical
07:57 <PeteHansen> jmalicki: should i send it?
07:57 <jmalicki> PeteHansen: i'm just like... tons of graphs and tabbles and equations
07:57 <jmalicki> i just
07:57 <jmalicki> don't know if that translates
08:02 <jmalicki> loool
08:02 <jmalicki> notmike: she is fucking hilarious
08:02 <jmalicki> she had an atlantic profile and i binged
08:03 <jmalicki> lol
08:06 <jmalicki> "and joseph was a massive cuck who raised another man's child, but it's cool, he was into that"
08:06 <jmalicki> notmike: very true
08:06 <jmalicki> but it's still hilarious
08:06 <jmalicki> lol
08:08 <jmalicki> like, anyone talking has a certain point of view
08:09 <jmalicki> one should have a healthy amount of skepticism towards everyone
08:09 <jmalicki> and listen to their critics
08:09 <jmalicki> i just.... epistimologically don't believe in facts
08:09 <jmalicki> except as like a platonic form
08:10 <jmalicki> notmike: with hilarious style
08:10 <jmalicki> and great cinematography
08:10 <jmalicki> like the cinematography is like epic
08:10 <jmalicki> lol
08:10 <jmalicki> yeah
08:10 <jmalicki> notmike: it's a big thing they have
08:11 <jmalicki> notmike: she calls him daddy
08:11 <jmalicki> notmike: the jordan peterson video is hilarious
08:11 <jmalicki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas&t=62s
08:11 <jmalicki> regardless of how you feel
08:11 <jmalicki> it has.... style
08:12 <jmalicki> notmike: (i mean, it makes sense she has particular butthurt due to being transgender)
08:14 <jmalicki> notmike: which specific sort of argument are you thinking of?
08:15 <jmalicki> like there's a bunch of different stuff that could get washed up there
08:15 <jmalicki> ah
08:16 <jmalicki> most of the nazi stuff got pushed out
08:16 <jmalicki> like steve bannon?
08:16 <jmalicki> he is like...
08:16 <jmalicki> umm
08:17 <jmalicki> you'd have a hard time convincing me he's not a nazi
08:17 <jmalicki> but ok, he got ejected
08:17 <jmalicki> ya
08:17 <jmalicki> notmike: i think it made more sense earlier on
08:17 <jmalicki> but trump got rid of those people
08:18 <jmalicki> steven miller is the only one left that i could plausibly call nazi
08:19 <jmalicki> no, it really doesn;t.
08:19 <jmalicki> it is exactly the same.
08:20 <jmalicki> people who want to build the wall and gassed the jews should be treated the same.
08:20 <jmalicki> taxes don't matter.
08:20 <jmalicki> human rights do.
08:23 <jmalicki> yes, but the fringe is quite loud now
08:23 <jmalicki> notmike: and no, nazis were not a special kind of evil.
08:24 <jmalicki> notmike: they included normal americans like TJ Watson and Henry Ford.
08:24 <jmalicki> notmike: that nazis were a special kind of evil is a myth
08:24 <jmalicki> they were quite pedestrian
08:24 <jmalicki> "the banality of evil"
08:25 <jmalicki> things got to the great evil of gassing jews one very small step outside of social norms at a time
08:25 <jmalicki> it wasn't like suddenly hitler came to power and gassed the jews
08:25 <jmalicki> the overton window just slowly shifted
08:26 <jmalicki> it was 6 years between hitler's dictatorship and kristallnacht
08:28 <jmalicki> notmike: the US has done things just as bad several times, so i dont belive it is
08:28 <jmalicki> and china, and cambodia, and uganda
08:28 <jmalicki> etc etc
08:28 <jmalicki> tryphe: evil like 99.99% of humanity
08:30 <jmalicki> like, the trail of tears was no better than the holocaust
08:30 <jmalicki> and that is Trump's role model that he hangs in the oval office.
08:31 <jmalicki> he was no better than hilter.
08:31 <jmalicki> evil incarnate.
08:31 <jmalicki> no, we're not.
08:31 <jmalicki> yes it is
08:32 <jmalicki> being human is not excusable
08:32 <jmalicki> being natural is not excusable
08:32 <jmalicki> rape murder and theft are natural and human
08:32 <jmalicki> they do
08:32 <jmalicki> the point of our society is to not accept that
08:32 <jmalicki> and kill that part of our nature to cooperate.
08:33 <jmalicki> nature is irrelevant, is it useful.
08:34 <jmalicki> no, there is only iterated game theory
08:34 <jmalicki> nature is just baggage that keeps from performing well at modern iterated game theory
08:34 <jmalicki> it is not something to idealize
08:35 <jmalicki> notmike: so let 1000 flowers bloom
08:36 <jmalicki> notmike:  i agree that humans aren;'t rational
08:36 <jmalicki> notmike: the humans that aren't rational can starve to death so humans evolve
08:36 <jmalicki> they were not rational, they were tribal
08:37 <jmalicki> they did not win, which is evidence they were irrational
08:37 <jmalicki> tryphe: you can fight nature, we have CRISPR
08:38 <jmalicki> notmike: it is now on my list, i did not
08:38 <jmalicki> notmike: thanks!
08:42 <tryphe> jmalicki, lol good point =p

<J> So, I want to make a trading bot. Would it be nice if it ran on Node.js with some wrapper for R to take care of the algos/strategies?
<moriarty> the cost, parametrisation of your strategy, performance probably will help constrain your choice of language, J
<moriarty> of course the requirements for backtesting boils down more to processor cycles and parallelising your code helps
<moriarty> while if you're switching your code to live trades to generate signals, then you'd be more interested in latency
<moriarty> and the language you choose may help give you an edge
<J> moriarty: thanks for that!
<J> moriarty: wouldn't it be best to use something low-level like go or rust then?
<moriarty> so C, C++ or Assembler helps coupled with hardware choices
<J> i was always under the impression go and rust were modernized, beautified versions of c and c++
<notmike> J: https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/introduction-to-mips-assembly-language-programming
<jmalicki> J rust is plenty fast
<jmalicki> J go is more about high concurrency than high throughput
<jmalicki> J: pros use VHDL or Verilog when they want fast. ASM is too high level
<J> jmalicki: so basically a rust kernel/master then that manages a swarm of rust slaves?
<jmalicki> J: whatever you want it to be
<jmalicki> J: in HFT people are literally designing their own microchips to get more speed.
<J> jmalicki: the people who design those microchips.. they do it because they failed to come up with a better, faster architecture?
<jmalicki> J: you fundamentally can't get that fast with the software abstractions
<jmalicki> J: they're submitting limit orders before the even fully received the entire quote
<jmalicki> J: like sending the limit order starts before receiving the notification of a trade completes
<jmalicki> J they're measuring latency in nanoseconds
<jmalicki> J: like the latency it takes is what a cpu needs to add a few numbers together
<J> sounds like these bots exist both in the past and the present, goodness gracious
<jmalicki> J: no, they just start work before they've received all necessary information
<jmalicki> J: like if you know you're going to update your quotes, but don't know the price yet, you can send out the bits of the packet that are before the price before you decide the new price
<jmalicki> it's like 100x more work and way harder to do it that way
<jmalicki> but when you really want to be at the head of the limit order book, you kinda need to
<jmalicki> since everyone is doing the same processing to the same trades and quotes
<jmalicki> and only the head of the limit order book ever gets the noise traders
<jmalicki> (or else, you need to make deals with brokers like robinhood to trade before things even hit the market)
<jmalicki> if you're slower than everyone else, you just trade with informed traders
<jmalicki> J: because of the need to be at the head of the limit order book, market making is pretty capital intensive
<jmalicki> J: if you can get away with being an aggressive hft that uses market orders (or limit orders that might cross) you can afford far more latency
<J> jmalicki: also maybe design ones own OS to help speed things up?
<J> jmalicki: http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/coyotos.html or something
<jmalicki> J: could. a lot of people are also into doing userspace networking for low latency
<jmalicki> J: like the Scylla database https://docs.scylladb.com/kb/dpdk-hardware/

So assuming I have my perfect little trading bot all dressed up in the prettiest school girl costume. Now I reckon it's not much problem to get her access to small exchanges like Deribit, Poloniex etc. But what about the big ones like NASDAQ and CBOE?
What do I need to do to get access, and assuming I do, how do I prevent these exchanges from manipulating my positions? Let's assume that my bots are already ultra-fast. Seems like a dead race, no?

01:41 <jmalicki> J: first, you have to become a registered broker/dealer
01:41 <jmalicki> J: estimates are this process costs about $2M to join and $500k/yr in compliance costs
01:41 <jmalicki> like legal fees etc
01:42 <jmalicki> J: or you could just like, use a broker
01:42 <J> Ah I see, great
01:42 <J> Yeah but if I have my own fully functional bot I guess I don't need one right?
01:42 <jmalicki> J: actually becoming an exchange member usually happens after you're trading hundreds of millions at least
01:42 <jmalicki> J: you do to avoid the need to become a registered broker dealer
01:42 <J> Ouch. Not quite there yet
01:42 <jmalicki> J: it's about liability
01:43 <jmalicki> J: you're not enough of a big boy yet to be part of the inner circle, you need to be sponsored by a broker
01:43 <jmalicki> who is
01:43 <J> :D
01:43 <jmalicki> J: it's not about technical capability, but about liability
01:43 <jmalicki> J: look for "sponsored DMA" if you actually want to put your computer inside an exchange datacenter
01:44 <J> Yeah I was like "i got the technical part all figured out now" and my friend was like "how do you actually get a hookup and not get fucked in the *** at the same time"?
01:44 <jmalicki> J: basically sponsored DMA is your broker adds a few nanoseconds of lag while they examine your trades to okay them
01:44 <jmalicki> J: getting rid of those few nanoseconds is a giant process
01:45 <J> Yep
01:45 <jmalicki> J: https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership
01:45 <thunderstrzok> ^ NYSE Equities Membership
01:45 <J> thank you so much
01:45 <J> We covered that giant process the other day IIRC
01:46 <J> I'll keep you posted - the solution is really sweet :D
01:46 <J> prolly nothing you haven't heard but
01:47 <jmalicki> J: i assume you've already gotten at least $10k in lawyer fees to just get the general idea
01:49 <J> jmalicki: No not yet

01:51 <jmalicki> J: have you started studying for the Series 24 exame?
01:52 <jmalicki> J: it's a strict requirement
05:18 <jmalicki> J: just focus on passing that series 24 if you don't want to use a broker
05:18 <jmalicki> it's no joke
05:20 <jmalicki> J: like, tons of well qualified people fail it
05:21 <J> jmalicki: oh my bad i thought you were talking to the indian guy!
05:21 <jmalicki> J: but if 9ns kills your strategy, and you don't have hundreds of millions in capital, i would probably not go forward
05:22 <jmalicki> like seriously, just go sponsored DMA through IB or lime
05:22 <jmalicki> if you're at the level where 9ns is an issue, the r&d cost to maintain that advantage is enormous
05:22 <jmalicki> possibly even in the billions
05:22 <jmalicki> to keep up that arms race
05:23 <jmalicki> like, you're laying your own fiber, etc at that point
05:23 <jmalicki> writing your own OS
05:23 <J> :)
05:23 <J> indeed!
05:23 <jmalicki> if you don't have hundreds of millions to billions
05:23 <jmalicki> the 9ns doesn't matter
05:23 <jmalicki> start there
05:23 <J> that was a childhood dream of mine for some reason, to improve the traditional unix kernel. and now it's a reality
05:23 <jmalicki> and if you start to win
05:23 <jmalicki> then you can worry abotu the rest
05:24 <jmalicki> i'm starting to feel you're delusional
05:24 <J> no dont worry
05:24 <jmalicki> J: seriously, try sponsored DMA before trying to join the NYSE
05:24 <jmalicki> J: otherwise, see a mental health professional. you're having issues with mania
05:24 <J> i will. thanks.
05:24 <J> hehe
05:24 <jmalicki> rottensox: yes
05:25 <rottensox> jmalicki: interesting... Bought Twtr at $34.29. Rekt. 
05:25 <jmalicki> J: or even less extreme, just using a brokerage api
05:25 <jmalicki> rottensox: oh i dunno, i only hold for a few minutes
05:25 <jmalicki> i know nothing about symbols or prices
05:25 <J> jmalicki: maybe!
05:25 <jmalicki> rottensox: that's like, investing not trading
05:26 <J> im gonna go for rust though. i had your blessing on that?
05:26 <rottensox> Yes sir. You're right on that. 
05:26 <jmalicki> J: whatever works
05:26 <J> sweet
05:26 <jmalicki> J: just focus on connecting to the api and getting feedback before dreaming too big
05:27 <J> Thanks for pointing out I might be delusional. I'm a bit Dunning Kruger, plus I know the financing is almost guaranteed.
05:27 <J> Yup
05:27 <jmalicki> J: many get financing. doesn't mean you can successfully invest
05:28 <jmalicki> J: getting financing first kills investing careers.
05:28 <jmalicki> since you can ruin your reputation
05:28 <jmalicki> better save your reputation once you've learned how to do it
05:28 <J> hehe.. work as a john doe for a few years? and then resurface as yourself?
05:28 <jmalicki> if you haven't totally failed at investing yet, you're not ready for other peoples' money
05:28 <jmalicki> no, go bankrupt several times first
05:29 <jmalicki> then you'll have learned some lessons
05:29 <jmalicki> then you're ready for opm
05:29 <J> yeah i've set aside a part of the budget for "lessons learned" :/
05:29 <jmalicki> J: you don't do that with opm
05:29 <jmalicki> J: unless you work for someone else and it's not your rep
05:29 <J> sorry opm?
05:30 <jmalicki> other peoples' money
05:30 <J> aaah
05:30 <jmalicki> if you have guaranteed financing that's awesome, don't blow it by using it before you're prepared
05:30 <J> my CV has drugs, hacking, fraud already so.. i'll just find a way to cover it all up with good design :D
05:30 <J> jmalicki: i really appreciate the warning
05:31 <J> my friend (the rapper above) pointed out the same thing about my ego. i'll check myself for real. and also read those two books you recommended before i present the business plan.
05:31 <J> the math phd i've found though. he's always high on morphine
05:32 <jmalicki> J: better yet you could trade for 6mos-1y before presenting your plan
05:32 <J> thats a good idea
05:32 <jmalicki> J: you learn lessons , and can show results, not just talk
05:32 <J> just paper trading right?
05:32 <jmalicki> J: that can work, but better if it's real
05:33 <jmalicki> J: especially if it's hft, paper trading is woefully inadequate
05:33 <J> good point, we wanna hft
05:34 <jmalicki> like, getting fills at all and/or at a good price is very hard to model w/ hft
05:35 <J> any chance i can note you down as senior advisor in the company and pay you a nice salary?
05:36 <astroo-> bye people
05:37 <J> or just note you down so you can get paid for the advice you've already given. you're the only guy who's helped me
05:37  * J off to learn rust
05:41 <jmalicki> J: i'd rather advise without having my name on it tbh
05:41 <jmalicki> i still think you're in over your head and should take smaller steps
05:42 <jmalicki> J: i don't doubt you can do it, but i think a slower approach where you have some failures at each step will be more useful at setting you up for success
05:43 <jmalicki> he's never heard of FINRA but wants to set up an HFT hedge fund as a member of the NYSE
05:44 <jmalicki> J: fail in the small before ruining your rep with people who will finance you
05:44 <jmalicki> and then come back having learned those lessons

05:51 <J> jmalicki: You can be "Anonymous"
05:51 <J> but yeah i dont wanna mess up my rep with this guy.
05:53 <J> jmalicki: See you then. Dying to show you my OS schematics too
05:53 <J> Have a good day man!
05:53  * J makes sure to copy/paste the convo as usual
06:46 <J> jmalicki: But basically - unless we're in the billionaire boys' club - we'll be forced to live with a (potentially devastating) nanosecond lag via the broker?
06:47 <jmalicki> J: if you can't deal with a few nanoseconds now, you won't be able to do the r&d to keep up when everyone else cuts milliseconds.
06:48 <jmalicki> J: like unless you're prepared to spend tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per year in overhead to reduce lag by milliseconds every year, you're not on the edge of ultra low latency
06:48 <jmalicki> so the extra few ns of the broker should not bother you
06:48 <jmalicki> your business model should reflect that you're not competing at the edge of latency
06:48 <jmalicki> and you need other edges
06:48 <J> jmalicki: So a good algo can make up for loss in speed?
06:48 <notmike> J: your humanity is greater than any ai
06:48 <J> good point
06:48 <jmalicki> J: to a degree
06:49 <notmike> thanks dawg
06:49 <J> My friend is lurking in here
06:49 <jmalicki> J: just.. .market making and earning the spread is about two things 1) speed 2) an algo to tell when to not trade
06:49 <J> He's all like "don't dooo ittt!!", big brother where you at?
06:49 <J> yes sir
06:49 <jmalicki> J: if you're trying to do something other than earn the spread, then speed is useful but not of ultimate importance
06:50 <jmalicki> J: like if you're willing to take rather than make liquidity
06:50 <notmike> jmalicki: I'm trying to 1) get money and 2) get paid
06:50 <J> We'll start the development of the OS early regardless. For when that day comes
06:50 <jmalicki> making liquidity is a speed game, except for knowing when to *not* trade is what takes smarts
06:50 <jmalicki> notmike: aren't we all
06:50 <J> notmike: I'm trying to not get my life ruined, the investor is former FBI
06:51 <J> * FBI boss
06:51 <J> or something like that, but yeah
06:51 <J> thanks again jmalicki 
06:51 <jmalicki> taking liquidity you can avoid the arms race a bit
06:51 <jmalicki> only a bit
06:52 <J> got it
06:52 <jmalicki> but of course,they're different business models
06:52 <jmalicki> notmike: i knew two people who made a bet. one got a summer internship at google, the other was a mime in harvard square. turns out the mime made more money
06:53 <jmalicki> of course, there's less career advancement in that line of work
06:54 <jmalicki> notmike: the mime also got a song written about him by amanda palmer
06:55 <notmike> that's one hell of a bet. a rich man's wager
06:55 <jmalicki> hah
06:58 <jmalicki> notmike: the moral of the story is , if you wanna get paid, be a mime
06:59 <notmike> what if i just want Amanda Palmer to like me?
06:59 <jmalicki> you should be a famous scifi writer
06:59 <jmalicki> that ship has sailed :)
