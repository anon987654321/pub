echo "a) Review analysis: ruby close_redundant_prs.rb"
echo "b) Test with dry-run: Use GitHub Actions with dry_run=true"
echo "c) Execute closures: Use GitHub Actions with dry_run=false, confirm_closure='CONFIRM'"
echo "d) Verify results: Check that redundant PRs are closed with appropriate comments"
echo "e) Focus on superior PRs: Review and merge PR #38 and PR #39"

echo "8. Safety Features:"
echo "✓ Dry-run mode prevents accidental closures"
echo "✓ Confirmation required for actual execution"
