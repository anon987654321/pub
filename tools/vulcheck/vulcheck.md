## Overview
`vulcheck.rb` is a Ruby-based script designed to detect system infections, rootkits, jailbreaks, and unauthorized system access. It automates the installation and updating of essential tools, performs in-depth security scans, and provides actionable logs for analysis.

### Key Features
- **macOS Support**: Uses `chkrootkit`, `rkhunter`, and `aide` to detect rootkits, malware, and file integrity issues. Fully compatible with legacy macOS versions.
- **iOS Jailbreak Detection**: Identifies common jailbreak indicators, ensuring a quick security assessment for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices.
- **Android Root Access Detection**: Detects root access indicators like `su` binaries and unauthorized system modifications.
- **Real-Time Intrusion Detection**: Scans active network connections and running processes to detect ongoing intrusions.
- **Automated Tool Management**: Updates detection tools to ensure the latest signatures and rules are applied.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on macOS, iOS, and Android.

## Requirements
### macOS
- **MacPorts**: Required to install and manage dependencies. Install from [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).
- **Root Privileges**: The script must be run with `sudo` to perform system-level scans.

### iOS
- **No Additional Setup Required**: The script detects jailbreak indicators with no need for installation.

### Android
- **Rooted or Non-Rooted Devices**: Supports scanning both rooted and non-rooted devices.
- **Optional**: Use [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) for an enhanced scanning environment.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;
   cd &lt;repository-folder&gt;
   ```
2. Ensure Ruby is installed:
   - macOS: Ruby comes pre-installed.
   - Android: Install Ruby via Termux:
     ```bash
     pkg update &amp;&amp; pkg upgrade
     pkg install ruby
     ```
3. For macOS, ensure MacPorts is installed and functional.

## Usage
Run the script with the appropriate option for your platform:

### macOS
Install dependencies, update tools, and perform full security scans:
```bash
sudo ruby vulcheck.rb --macos
```

### iOS
Scan for jailbreak indicators and perform basic security checks:
```bash
sudo ruby vulcheck.rb --ios
```

### Android
Detect root access indicators and unauthorized system modifications:
```bash
ruby vulcheck.rb --android
```

## Logs
All results are logged to `vulcheck_log.txt` in the current directory. Logs include:
- Timestamped actions and scan results.
- Identified rootkits, suspicious files, and unauthorized access indicators.
- Summaries of active connections and processes.

## Notes
- **macOS**: Regularly update tools (`chkrootkit` and `rkhunter`) to ensure detection rules remain effective.
- **iOS**: Jailbreaking is not required for basic checks but enables deeper scans.
- **Android**: The presence of the `su` binary typically indicates root access; review logs carefully to verify.

## Limitations
- **Non-Jailbroken iOS Devices**: Limited to basic checks for jailbreak indicators.
- **Unrooted Android Devices**: Cannot access system-level files; limited to user-space scans.
- **macOS SIP**: System Integrity Protection may restrict scans of critical files on newer macOS versions.
